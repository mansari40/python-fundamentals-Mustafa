**Abstract**


Accurate macroeconomic forecasting has become harder amid geopolitical disruptions, policy reversals, and volatile financial markets. Conventional vector autoregressions (VARs) overfit in highdimensional settings, while threshold VARs struggle with time-varying interdependencies and complex parameter structures. We address these limitations by extending the Sims–Zha Bayesian
VAR with exogenous variables (SZBVARx) to incorporate domain-informed shrinkage and four
newspaper-based uncertainty shocks—economic policy uncertainty, geopolitical risk, US equity
market volatility, and US monetary policy uncertainty. The framework improves structural interpretability, mitigates dimensionality, and imposes empirically guided regularization. Using G7
data, we study spillovers from uncertainty shocks to five core variables—unemployment, real broad
effective exchange rates, short-term rates, oil prices, and CPI inflation—combining wavelet coherence (time–frequency dynamics) with nonlinear local projections (state-dependent impulse responses). Out-of-sample results at 12- and 24-month horizons show that SZBVARx outperforms 14
benchmarks, including classical VARs and leading machine-learning models, as confirmed by Murphy difference diagrams, multivariate Diebold–Mariano tests, and Giacomini–White predictability
tests. Credible Bayesian prediction intervals deliver robust uncertainty quantification for scenario
analysis and risk management. The proposed SZBVARx offers G7 policymakers a transparent,
well-calibrated tool for modern macroeconomic forecasting under pervasive uncertainty.

**1. Introduction**


Uncertainty is deeply ingrained in the growth and development process of the G7 economies:
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The economic
importance of accurate macroeconomic forecasting for these countries is self-evident. Collectively,
the G7 economies account for about 28–30% of global GDP, more than 40% of global household
wealth, and are home to the deepest and most liquid financial markets in the world (International


Monetary Fund, 2024b; Credit Suisse Research Institute, 2023). The G7 also host four of the world’s
five largest currencies, with the US dollar, euro, yen, and pound sterling together accounting for
about 89% of disclosed official foreign-exchange reserves. For these reasons, the G7 economies are
by far the largest anchors of the international monetary system (International Monetary Fund,
2024a; Gopinath, Boz, Casas, Díez, Gourinchas & Plagborg-Møller, 2020). The G7 is also home to
the majority of systemically important financial institutions and is the world’s largest source and
recipient of cross-border capital flows (Rey, 2015; Miranda-Agrippino & Ricco, 2021). Given this
significant footprint in world trade, finance, and monetary conditions, shocks that originate in the
G7 or are transmitted through it have sizable spillover effects on emerging markets and the global
economy more broadly (Bloom, Bunn, Mizen, Smietanka & Thwaites, 2019). The G7’s growth
outlook continues to be buffeted by a perfect storm of adverse global shocks (including financial
crises, political instability, technological change, wars, pandemics, and more), of which uncertainty,
shocks, and their transmission are key (Baker, Bloom & Davis, 2016; Caldara & Iacoviello, 2022;
Bloom, 2009). At the heart of this storm lie the network interactions among five key macroeconomic
variables (unemployment rate, real broad effective exchange rate (REER), short-term interest rates
(SIR), oil prices, and consumer price index (CPI) inflation), which are not only highly interrelated but also extremely sensitive to exogenous uncertainty shocks of all types (e.g., economic and
monetary policy uncertainties, geopolitical risk, financial market volatility etc.). The shocks have
been becoming more frequent and larger in magnitude, which has severe and measurable adverse
impacts on expectations, financial stability, inflation, and real activity in the G7 economies. Forecasting frameworks can no longer be based only on fundamentals but must explicitly account for
high-frequency information on uncertainty, which continues to be generated at an unprecedented
speed and scale. Empirical studies in recent literature indicate that uncertainty shocks feed into
each other (i.e., so-called “uncertainty multipliers"), which change the well-documented causal relationships among key macroeconomic variables, destabilize labor markets and investment, and result
in volatile swings in exchange rates, flows, and prices (Caggiano, Castelnuovo & Groshenny, 2014;
Smales, 2022; Rossi, 2013; Yang, Zhang, Liu, Liu, Tao, Lai & Huang, 2024). We treat them as core
drivers of G7 forecasts.


In this paper, we examine the response of five macroeconomic variables—unemployment rate,
REER, SIR, the oil price, and CPI inflation—to four sources of uncertainty shocks: economic policy uncertainty (EPU), geopolitical risk (GPR), US equity market volatility (USEMV), and US
monetary policy uncertainty (USMPU). Such shocks, which encompass a range of uncertainty from
policy-related disagreements to geopolitical tensions, are recognized as major driving forces of the
outlook in advanced economies, and particularly G7 countries (Jones & Olson, 2013; Baker et al.,
2016; Caldara & Iacoviello, 2022). Our work, therefore, is timely, as their increasing prominence
in the economy suggests that they should be included in the forecasting system to understand and
monitor the macroeconomic implications of global uncertainty and, potentially, to inform policy.
The ongoing process of deepening interdependence across countries is a major motivation for multivariate forecasting as a key tool for G7 policymakers to monitor the interdependent co-movements
of unemployment, inflation, exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.


This article presents a structured platform to link the different uncertainty shocks to outcomes
by emphasizing the G7 economy. The labor market, foreign exchange market, monetary policy, oil
market, and CPI inflation outcomes are observed to be highly responsive to the jointly moving EPU,

GPR, USEMV, and USMPU variables in the G7 (Baker et al., 2016; Caldara & Iacoviello, 2022;
Bloom, 2009; Caggiano et al., 2014; Smales, 2022; Jurado, Ludvigson & Ng, 2015). At the same
time, pronounced spikes in EPU and GPR are linked to deteriorations in employment, volatile
inflation and interest rates, shifting risk premia, and volatile exchange rates, particularly in the
context of systemic cross-country shocks (Baker et al., 2016; Caldara & Iacoviello, 2022; Bloom,
2009; Caggiano et al., 2014; Smales, 2022; Jurado et al., 2015). These can propagate quickly
through financial and trade linkages, inducing capital flows and currency realignments (Forbes &
Warnock, 2012; Rossi, 2013; Ahir, Bloom & Furceri, 2022; Bekaert, Hoerova & Duca, 2013). Labor
market responses are also particularly important, with hiring and investment often retrenching in
the face of rising uncertainty (Bloom, 2009; Caggiano et al., 2014). By contrast, exchange rates
tend to track sudden, uncertainty-induced capital flows, (Forbes & Warnock, 2012; Smales, 2022).
The recent USMPU can also transmit the interest rate, and particularly so when mixed with EPU
and GPR (Husted, Rogers & Sun, 2020; Tillmann, 2020). Oil price shocks are another potentially
strong source of inflation and growth uncertainty, which have been found to respond strongly
to policy and geopolitical news and interact with financial speculation (Kilian, 2009; Baumeister
& Kilian, 2016; Kilian & Murphy, 2014; Kang, Ratti & Vespignani, 2017). In addition, the latest
inflation evidence in the G7 shows it is now more sensitive to external uncertainty shocks and policy
changes than to domestic slack (Coibion, Gorodnichenko & Ulate, 2019; Fajgelbaum, Goldberg,
Kennedy & Khandelwal, 2020). Recent developments in the cross-country modeling frontier are
therefore especially relevant for modeling the global nature of the interactions and support the
use of multiple sources of uncertainty when forecasting the policy-relevant variables (Bai, Carriero,
Clark & Marcellino, 2022; Baker et al., 2016; Caldara & Iacoviello, 2022).


In a data-rich environment like the G7, Bayesian VAR models, proposed by Litterman (1986);
Sims, Doan & Litterman (1983); Sims & Zha (1998) have long been recognized as a well-performing
benchmark. Recent developments, including hierarchical shrinkage priors (Bańbura, Giannone &
Reichlin, 2010), stochastic volatility priors (Koop, 2013), and extensions to multi-country or highdimensional macro systems (Miranda-Agrippino & Ricco, 2019; Bai et al., 2022; Besher, Sengupta &
Chakraborty, 2025) continue to improve the accuracy and flexibility of these models (Carriero, Clark
& Marcellino, 2019a; Feldkircher, Huber, Koop & Pfarrhofer, 2022; Gefang, Koop & Poon, 2023).
On the empirical front, there is the need to include external drivers into the forecasting models,
such as EPU (Baker et al., 2016), GPR (Caldara & Iacoviello, 2022), and financial or monetary
shocks (Husted et al., 2020; Tang, 2015), as they have a significant impact on inflation, exchange
rates, and other macro dynamics (Carriero, Galvao & Kapetanios, 2019b; Sengupta, Chakraborty &
Singh, 2025; Bojer, 2022; Chakraborty, Besher, Panja & Sengupta, 2025). At the same time, a rich
set of methodological advances, such as Bayesian Global VARs (Canova & Ciccarelli, 2004; Pesaran,
Schuermann & Smith, 2009; Cuaresma, Feldkircher & Huber, 2016), time-varying parameter VARs
(Koop & Korobilis, 2013; Bekiros, 2014), and deep learning models for multi-horizon prediction
(Laborda, Ruano & Zamanillo, 2023), are being used to capture a range of complex features in the
data, such as nonlinearities, regime changes, and spillovers.


Despite these advancements, classical and Bayesian VARs remain prominent forecasting
workhorses but face limitations in capturing nonlinear dynamics, structural breaks, and uncertainty
shock propagation (Sims & Zha, 1998; Koop & Korobilis, 2013; Canova, 2011; Kilian & Lütkepohl,
2017). Threshold and Markov-switching VARs introduce regime shifts, yet their complexity con

3


strains practical use in high-dimensional G7 environments (Balke & Fomby, 1997; Lo & Zivot,
2001). Even recent time-varying parameter Bayesian VARs with structural identification can overlook key external policy and financial shocks (Koop & Korobilis, 2013; Del Negro & Schorfheide,
2008; Carriero et al., 2019a). The Sims-Zha Bayesian VAR with exogenous variables (SZBVARx)
framework directly incorporates major uncertainty sources (Baker et al., 2016; Caldara & Iacoviello,
2022; Husted et al., 2020). Unlike previous VAR approaches to uncertainty, SZBVARx allows these
shocks to have unrestricted effects on all of the core macroeconomic variables. In contrast to some
large-scale multi-country models, SZBVARx allows for a good degree of country-level granularity
but also explicitly introduces cross-country spillovers using a common set of exogenous variables
(Pesaran et al., 2009; Cuaresma et al., 2016). Bayesian shrinkage in the SZBVARx model helps to
ensure reliable estimation, especially in high-dimensional environments (Belmonte, Koop & Korobilis, 2014).


Against this background, the present paper contributes to the existing literature on three main
fronts. _First_, on methods and theory, we propose a framework in which uncertainty is explicitly
modeled as an autonomous and structural driver of the G7 macroeconomy. We directly incorporate
four externally measured uncertainty indices in a Sims–Zha Bayesian VAR with exogenous variables (Jurado et al., 2015; Ludvigson, Ma & Ng, 2021; Baker et al., 2016; Caldara & Iacoviello,
2022), and treat uncertainty as a predictive state variable that augments more standard shocks.
We couple nonlinear local projections (Carriero et al., 2019b) to recover regime-dependent impulse
responses with shrinkage-based Bayesian estimation for robust inference in moderately large systems. We use Bayesian posterior sampling to construct predictive credible intervals that account
for forecast uncertainty, providing empirically calibrated credible intervals (Bańbura et al., 2010;
Carriero et al., 2019b; Koop, 2013). _Second_, on evidence, we consider five major macroeconomic
variables for G7 countries. Long-run wavelet coherence confirms that uncertainty indices systematically lead macroeconomic variables along the business cycle and during major events like the global
financial crisis and COVID-19, highlighting their value as truly exogenous drivers. State-dependent
impulse responses reveal a number of regime asymmetries, with uncertainty shocks being both
more impactful on prices and real quantities under tight monetary conditions and more persistent
in easy regimes, especially through external channels for open economies. A thorough forecast
evaluation against fourteen classical, machine-learning, and deep-learning benchmarks at 12- and
24-month horizons further highlights consistent gains in accuracy across a number of standard loss
functions, validated by Multiple Comparisons with the Best, multivariate Diebold–Mariano and Giacomini–White tests, as well as Murphy-difference diagrams. _Third_, on application, our approach
delivers output in a form that can be directly utilized by central banks and other policy institutions, including regime-conditioned impulse responses, coherent medium-term projections, and
thus ready to be used in real time to assess, monitor, and report measures of forecast uncertainty,
aiding in risk management, forward guidance, and scenario planning, as needed in environments
of geopolitical or financial uncertainty (Bernanke, 2015; Adrian, Boyarchenko & Giannone, 2019;
Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana, Rubio-Ramírez & Uribe, 2011; Huber, Koop, Onorante,
Pfarrhofer & Schreiner, 2023). This paper bridges the gap between state-of-the-art econometric
methods and the real-world need for uncertainty-aware forecasting of advanced economies.

and treatment of exogenous shocks. Section 5 reports the forecasting study such as baselines, performance metrics, results and experimental comparisons, significance and robustness, and uncertainty

**2. Data and Preliminary Analysis**


This study is concerned with the macroeconomic dynamics of the G7 countries. In particular,
we jointly analyze five macro variables—Unemployment Rate, Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate
(REER), Short-term Interest Rate (SIR), Oil Prices proxied by the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI), and consumer price index (CPI) Inflation—together with four newspaper-based
uncertainty measures: log-transformed country-wise Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU), countrywise Geopolitical Risk (GPR), US Equity Market Volatility (USEMV), and US Monetary Policy
Uncertainty (USMPU). The sample spans January 1995 to March 2024, a window that includes
multiple business-cycle phases, a Global Financial Crisis, a zero lower bound era, and the COVID-19
pandemic, a global pandemic shock. We assess forecast performance using a rolling window design
at two horizons: 12-month-ahead (“semi-long-term”) and 24-month-ahead (“long-term”). This allows
us to contrast medium-run accuracy with longer-run stability in timeframes relevant for policy and
investment decisions. The Section 2.1 documents the key data features through summary statistics
and global characteristics, followed by tests for endogeneity among key macroeconomic variables
and structural break detection.


_2.1. Global Characteristics_


This section provides a broad description of the data organization involved in our multivariate
analysis for the G7 countries. We concentrate on five major macroeconomic variables, which are
the unemployment rate, REER, SIR, oil price (WTI), and CPI inflation. These five macroeconomic
indicators were chosen as they are key factors for major advanced economies. The unemployment
rate is a measure of slack in the labor market and cyclical variation in employment. It is obtained
from the Infra-Annual Labor Statistics. The REER is a weighted average of bilateral exchange
rates and is normalized by relative consumer prices. It is used as a measure of each economy’s
external competitiveness. SIR is used as a proxy for the stance of monetary policy and liquidity
conditions. We use the three-month interbank rate for this purpose. Oil price (WTI) is included
as a summary of global commodity market conditions that feed into both production costs and
inflationary pressures. CPI inflation is the year-on-year change in consumer prices, and thus it
measures the purchasing power of households and is the most direct indicator of price stability. All
the macroeconomic series are sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database
to ensure methodological consistency and cross-country comparability. A first pass through the
trends and variability - plotted for each country-variable pair and presented in Figure A.1.1 of Appendix A.1.1 of the supplementary material, reveals substantial heterogeneity. Pronounced cyclical
swings and crisis-related spikes characterize unemployment and CPI inflation, while exchange rates
and oil prices exhibit more structural volatility. SIRs appear to be impacted by distinct monetary


5


policy regimes across the entire sample period, including the extended era of the zero lower bound
(a prolonged period, particularly since the global financial crisis, when central banks kept shortterm interest rates near zero, limiting conventional policy and leading to widespread adoption of
tools such as quantitative easing and forward guidance). The autocorrelation diagnostics (see Appendix A.1.2, Figure A.1.2) indicate that most series display strong persistence through a gradually
decaying autocorrelation structure. This widespread persistence motivates the use of a Bayesian
VAR framework, which naturally accommodates persistent dynamics through its autoregressive
structure while simultaneously capturing joint dynamics and cross-country spillover effects through
the multivariate specification (Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, 2018; Diebold & Yilmaz, 2009; Pesaran, Schuermann & Weiner, 2004). Additionally, four newspaper-based high-frequency measures
of uncertainty that are designed to capture different dimensions of global risk and policy uncertainty
are utilized in this study. We start with the EPU index of Baker et al. (2016), which is constructed
as the frequency of terms related to policy and uncertainty in leading newspapers. We follow Bloom
(2009) and take the natural logarithm of the series (EPU) to reduce heteroscedasticity and the effect
of spikes in uncertainty. The country-wise GPR index of Caldara & Iacoviello (2022) is designed
to measure geopolitical risks to the global economy that stem from geopolitical events such as
terrorism, armed conflict, and political and economic instability, using a news dataset hand-coded
at the international level. It includes both sudden spikes in uncertainty and background levels of
geopolitical tensions. USEMV index of Baker, Bloom, Davis & Kost (2019) is the share of news
articles that connect economic and financial volatility to U.S. stock market returns and is thus a
forward-looking measure of financial market stress. USMPU index of Husted et al. (2020) is based
on a set of terms relating to monetary policy and uncertainty and constructed as the frequency
with which articles in leading financial newspapers use those terms to identify uncertainty in Federal Open Market Committee decisions. These four indices are designed to provide complementary
coverage of policy, geopolitical, financial-market, and monetary uncertainty, respectively.


Standard summary statistics, describing the distribution of the series, namely (minimum, quartiles, median, mean, standard deviation, and maximum) and two complexity measures: the coefficient of variation (CoV) and entropy, to describe the distributions of both macro series and
uncertainty indices, are reported in Table 1. The CoV, standard deviation divided by the mean,
renders volatility comparable across units of observation. A higher CoV implies that observations
are more dispersed, making point forecasting more difficult. Entropy is a measure of randomness
in distributions. It can be viewed as a proxy for informational complexity: higher entropy implies
distributions are more dispersed and harder to predict. The picture is not uniform across countries.
Some labor-market series are characterized by high CoV and entropy consistent with their erratic
dynamics. In a number of countries, inflation also displays relatively high complexity. USEMV
and USMPU, along with oil prices, appear to be among the more idiosyncratic exogenous drivers,
as they display high CoV and entropy. This is also a manifestation of their episodic, shock-driven
behavior that also transmits more forecast uncertainty. These findings demonstrate the need for a
flexible, robust forecasting framework for the G7 economies.

To provide a comprehensive overview of the properties of the series, considered in this study,
we report seven key statistical properties: skewness, kurtosis, nonlinearity, seasonality, stationarity, long-range dependence, and presence of outliers - in Table 2. The nonlinearity is captured by
Tsay’s and Keenan’s test (Tsay, 1986; Keenan, 1985), which tests for departure from linear autoregressive structure and can accommodate threshold or regime-switching dynamics. The seasonality
is captured by the Ollech–Webel combined procedure (Ollech & Webel, 2023), which is a robust
diagnostic that bundles up several different tests to reduce misclassification. The stationarity is
checked by the KPSS test (Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt & Shin, 1992), which takes stationarity
as the null and is used in conjunction with standard unit-root tests. The long-range dependence
is captured by the Hurst exponent (Shang, 2020), which differentiates between mean-reverting,
memoryless, and trend-reinforcing behavior. The outliers are detected by Bonferroni-adjusted tests
based on studentized residuals (Weisberg & Cook, 1982), which filter the rare but influential shocks.
The diagnostics suggest that most of the G7 macroeconomic series are non-stationary, nonlinear,
and exhibit long memory. Table 2 also indicates the presence of seasonality, mainly evident in
unemployment rates, EPU, and USEMV. Statistically significant outliers cluster around the global
financial crisis and the pandemic. In sum, the evidence suggests complex, persistent, and sometimes
volatile dynamics, which call for uncertainty-resilient multivariate models that can accommodate
nonlinearity, regime shifts, and persistent shocks.


To investigate potential endogeneity within a block of macroeconomic variables, we implement
the Wu–Hausman (WH) test for the five principal variables in each of the G7 economies (Wu, 1973;
Hausman, 1978; Heinisch, Scaramella & Schult, 2025). The Wu-Hausman (WH) test for endogeneity
compares the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Instrumental Variable (IV) estimators: OLS is
efficient under exogeneity, but becomes inconsistent if regressors are endogenous, while IV remains
consistent in both cases. The WH statistic measures the difference between these estimators, which
should be asymptotically zero if all regressors are exogenous, and the null hypothesis follows a
chi-squared distribution. Using a 10% significance level, p-values below 0.10 lead to rejection of
exogeneity—indicating possible feedback or simultaneity and confirming the need for IV estimation
(Hausman, 1978; Wu, 1973). Country-specific statistics and p-values (presented in Table 3) provide
evidence of endogeneity at this threshold, supporting treatment of the block of these macroeconomic
variables as a jointly determined system and the use of the four uncertainty indices as external
drivers in the forecasting framework.

Finally, we assess the structural stability of the VAR model using the cumulative sum (CUSUM)
based on the OLS procedure (Ploberger & Krämer, 1992) over the five macroeconomic variables,
with potential implications for both specification and evaluation (Stock & Watson, 1996; Hansen,
2001). Appendix A.1.3 presents Figure A.1.3, which reveals heterogeneous patterns. The unemployment rate clearly presents episodes of instability for several economies around some targeted
episodes (early 2000s and post-2012 in parts of the sample). REER registers breaks in a few
countries in the early 2000s. Oil prices exhibit common breaks across all G7 in 2008–2009 and
2014–2015, consistent with global commodity shocks (although none of the breaks are found to
be statistically significant). Most critically, SIRs exhibit systematic structural breaks in Canada,
the United States, France, and Japan, consistent with the zero lower bound, quantitative-easing
phases, and subsequent normalizations (Bernanke, 2020; Yellen, 2017). By contrast, Germany, the
United Kingdom, and Italy display CUSUM paths within the confidence bands, consistent with


9


relative parameter stability. CPI inflation is comparatively more stable across the G7, and the few
near-significant breakpoints are consistent with credible inflation-targeting frameworks (Mishkin &
Schmidt-Hebbel, 2007; Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin & Posen, 2000).

Overall, the descriptive statistics, structural diagnostics, endogeneity tests, and stability checks
jointly motivate our modeling choices. The macro series are persistent, often nonlinear, and subject
to structural change; the uncertainty indices are high-frequency and shock-driven; there is evidence
of feedback within the block of macroeconomic variables and of regime shifts - particularly in SIRs.
These features argue for multivariate, shrinkage-based methods that can handle high-dimensional
systems; for state-dependent tools to trace transmission under different monetary environments;
and for forecasting designs that evaluate both medium- and long-run horizons. This empirical
groundwork justifies the inclusion and treatment of variables in the forecasting system and guides
the specification of the multivariate framework applied to the data.


**3. Causality Analysis**


The time–frequency causality analysis to map how uncertainty relates to the macro indicators is
presented in Section 3.1. Then, transmission paths are assessed using impulse response analysis in
Section 3.2. These diagnostics provide the empirical basis for variable selection, clarify propagation
channels, and motivate the multivariate forecasting framework applied in subsequent sections.


_3.1. Wavelet Coherence Evidence for Uncertainty Transmission in the G7_


In this section, we examine the causal relationships between our focal macroeconomic variables and exogenous uncertainty measures in the G7 economies in the time-frequency space using
wavelet coherence analysis (WCA), which was originally proposed by Grinsted, Moore & Jevrejeva (2004) and subsequently extended with scale-wise False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction by
Aguiar-Conraria & Soares (2014). WCA is used as a descriptive time-frequency diagnostic to identify co-movement and lead-lag patterns whose strength and direction may differ across horizons and
over time; as such, the resulting maps are interpreted as evidence on transmission timing and relevant frequency bands, rather than as structural tests of causality. Wavelet coherence plots visualize
time-frequency information, with information on the lead-lag (phase) between the two variables


10


being analyzed represented by the direction of the arrows in the plot. Arrows pointing to the right
(left) represent an in-phase (anti-phase) relation between the pair of variables, whereas upward
(downward) pointing arrows represent a leading (lagging) relation in time. The cone of influence
boundaries, by identifying the areas where edge effects could undermine statistical reliability, ensure the reliable interpretation of the coherence patterns throughout the analysis. The scale-wise
application of FDR correction, using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, systematically removes
statistically unreliable coherence regions at each temporal scale independently.


As a result, only the segments of the estimated coherence function that are unlikely to be
affected by spurious inferences of significant deviations from zero will be apparent in the resulting
maps. In these maps, shades of red (coherence values near 1 on a 0-1 scale) indicate the time points
and frequencies at which the lead-lag relationship between uncertainty shocks and fundamentals is
most likely to be statistically significant. The scale-wise FDR screen removes visually attractive
but fragile patches, thereby increasing confidence that remaining shaded regions reflect genuine
time–frequency associations rather than multiple-testing artifacts.


We compute bivariate coherence between each uncertainty index and macro series for each
country using the complex Morlet wavelet ( _ω_ _o_ = 6), which is implemented through the `biwavelet`
**R** package. To prevent look-ahead bias, the WCA is calculated only in the in-sample period
(Jan, 1995 – Mar, 2022), which is distinct from the 24 months reserved for out-of-sample forecast
validation. Statistical significance is determined using 1,000 Monte Carlo replications and controlled
at each scale with a Benjamini–Hochberg FDR adjustment set at _α_ = 10%; only regions that remain
significant after FDR correction are shaded (see Appendix A.1.4 for a more technical discussion of
the FDR-corrected WCA).


Figure 1 shows a canonical example (Canada), and similar grids of WCA for the remaining
G7 appear in the Appendix A.1.4 (Figures A.1.4 – A.1.9). Three patterns stand out in the case
of Canada. First, coherence is strongest at intermediate periodicities (multi-quarter to multiyear bands) and exhibits pronounced clustering around 2008–2009 and 2020–2021 (reflecting the
global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively). This dominance of the medium
term is consistent with the shock-driven nature of the uncertainty indices as well as the stylized
volatility documented for oil prices and exchange rates. Second, coherence is stronger in times
of stress relative to tranquil periods, suggesting that uncertainty and macroeconomic aggregates
co-move more closely when policy and financial conditions are tight. Phase information frequently
reveals the uncertainty series leading the macroeconomic variables in these frequency bands. Third,
frequency localization varies across variables: SIR and REER co-move with USEMV and USMPU at
short-to-medium periodicities (consistent with policy and financial-expectations channels), whereas
unemployment rate and CPI inflation exhibit more medium-to-long periodicities vis-à-vis EPU and
GPR, suggesting a slower speed of real-side adjustment. Cross-country heterogeneity is nontrivial.
For the United States, coherence between oil prices and uncertainty is especially strong; for the
European economies, inflation–uncertainty coherence is pronounced; and for Japan, low-frequency
REER synchronization is observed with US-centered uncertainty measures.


The existence of FDR-robust regions in which uncertainty drives macroeconomic variables justifies treating EPU, GPR, USEMV, and USMPU as exogenous drivers in the multivariate forecasting

Each subplot visualizes the time-frequency coherence between a macroeconomic variable (y-axis: Scale; x-axis: Frequency) and an uncertainty index, with warm colors (red/yellow) indicating intervals of high, statistically significant
co-movement after FDR correction. The direction of phase arrows indicates lead-lag relationships: rightward arrows
mean the series move in phase; leftward, in anti-phase; upward arrows signify the uncertainty index leads; downward,
that it lags. Shaded regions inside the cone of influence reflect reliable coherence, while grid consistency enables
robust cross-variable and cross-period comparison. The level of significance ( _α_ ) for the FDR adjustment is set at
10%.

framework and thus complements the endogeneity evidence in the block of macroeconomic variables
documented in Section 2.1 (Table 3). Overall, FDR-corrected WCA offers evidence on when and at
what frequencies uncertainty shocks are associated with G7 macroeconomic aggregates, thus motivating an exogenous uncertainty block, stance conditioning, and horizon choice in the forecasting
framework.


_3.2. Impulse response analysis_


This section focuses on the responses of the five key macroeconomic variables to the four
newspaper-based uncertainty measures. The choice of the uncertainty drivers is based on the
evidence presented in Section 3.1. This identification of exogenous uncertainty drivers informs the
design of our empirical impulse-response analysis. We estimate impulse response functions using
nonlinear local projections, as in Jordà (2005) (See Appendix A.1.5 for details). This methodology runs horizon-specific regressions that directly map innovations in the uncertainty measures
to future values of each macro variable, without the need to invert a full VAR system or to impose strong parametric restrictions. We use the nonlinear extension described in Adämmer (2019),
which employs a logistic transition function to generate state-contingent responses; observations
are smoothly weighted by proximity to each regime, allowing both the size and timing of effects to
depend on the monetary environment. As discussed in Section 3.1, the predominance of statistically
significant coherence at medium-to-long periodicities suggests that dynamic interactions between
uncertainty indices and financial or policy variables are most salient at these horizons. Guided
by this frequency-localized coherence, we set both our key forecast horizons (12 and 24 months,
corresponding to semi-long-term and long-term windows) and the maximal horizon for our impulse
response analysis to align with the bands in which the strongest and most persistent co-movements
and lead-lag relationships are identified. This ensures that our forecasting and IRF exercises are
empirically grounded and tied directly to cycles supported by the underlying time-frequency evidence.


Lag orders of the endogenous macroeconomic variables (6 months) and exogenous uncertainty
indicators (4 months) are chosen by using the Bayesian Information Criterion to account for persistence and delayed effects, respectively. Newey-West robust standard errors (Newey & West,
1987a) are used to compute the 95% confidence intervals, which are able to cope with time-varying
volatility, especially during periods of crisis. Regime switching is lagged ( `lag-switching = TRUE` )
to ensure that the switching coincides with the pre-shock monetary environment. The IRF plots
distinguish high-rate (blue) and low-rate (orange) regimes, while shaded regions represent 95% confidence bands. We compute horizon-by-horizon impulse responses up to 24 months. The smooth
regime-switching is done by setting the regime probability following a logistic function, with curvature parameter _γ_ = 3 to have a compromise between smooth transition and separation of the
two regimes. Deterministic trends are turned off ( `trend = 0` ) to focus on cyclical features, and
standardization of the short-term interest rate is done for each country to compare the magnitude
across countries and over time. The country-specific IRFs are documented for Canada in Figures 2

- 3 and for the other six G7 economies in the Appendix A.1.6 (Figures A.1.10 - A.1.21), the United
States (Figures A.1.10 and A.1.11), France (Figures A.1.12 and A.1.13), Germany (Figures A.1.14
and A.1.15), Japan (Figures A.1.16 and A.1.17), the United Kingdom (Figures A.1.18 and A.1.19)
and Italy (Figures A.1.20 and A.1.21).

The country-specific plots show responses (EPU, GPR, USEMV, USMPU) of uncertainty shocks
for five macroeconomic variables. Dotted horizontal lines represent zero baselines, and shaded
bands are 95% confidence intervals. The sample period is January, 1995 –Mar, 2024, where gradual
changes in policy transmission are also captured through state-contingent responses across different
monetary regimes (Jordà, 2005). The country grids display the impulse responses of the unemployment rate, REER, SIR, oil price (WTI), and CPI inflation to EPU, GPR, USEMV, and USMPU
under the high- and low-rate regimes. We use the SIR as the regime-switching variable in the local
projections framework for three reasons. First, following the documented evidence on the G7 in
aggregate, the main episodes of monetary policy actions in each country before and after 2020 have
also been associated with clear structural breaks in each country’s short rate dynamics, both in the
mean-reversion and in the volatility properties of short rates. The same is true for both the COVID
shock and recovery episodes, where reallocation in rate dynamics and regime-dependent volatility
are particularly large (think, e.g., of the US taper tantrum episode or the ECB PEPP announcement) (Darracq Pariès, Kornprobst & Priftis, 2024). Second, the available evidence on nonlinear
rate adjustments, and in particular on the documented asymmetries in short-term rate responses to
inflation, output, and the term spread, are better accounted for by regime-switching specifications
rather than linear models (Haug & Siklos, 2006; Ang & Bekaert, 2002). Third, the OLS-CUSUM
diagnostic suggests the presence of clear structural breaks in several G7 countries’ short rates. The
zero-lower-bound and quantitative easing episodes, as well as the subsequent policy normalizations,
broadly line up with those. Overall, these pieces of evidence jointly provide strong support for the
use of the short rate as the regime threshold in the nonlinear local projections design.


For Canada (Figures 2 and 3), IRFs are characterized by pronounced regime asymmetry. In
high-rate states, EPU leads to transitory unemployment spikes alongside REER depreciation and
a tightening bias in SIR, whereas GPR reinforces this pattern with sizable rate hikes and more
volatile CPI inflation. In low-rate environments, similar shocks are met with accommodation and
currency appreciation, but unemployment increases. USEMV effects are more muted, whereas
USMPU highlights Canada’s financial integration with the United States through divergent REER
and CPI inflation paths. The sign of CPI inflation responses also reverses with stance—positive
in high-rate states and negative in low-rate states—pointing to regime-dependent expectations
around imported prices and domestic slack; this is in line with asymmetric transmission in Canada
(Bhuiyan & Lucas, 2007). Stance dependence is salient for the United States (Figures A.1.10 and
A.1.11). At high rates, EPU raises unemployment at its peak in month 14, coincides with large
negative oil price responses during months 14–16, and drives near-term increases in CPI inflation
with peaks at months 5–7 and again near month 10. GPR appreciates the REER, particularly
via safe-haven flows. Low rates lead to amplified and more persistent real effects of EPU, keeping
unemployment higher through month 16 while also generating persistent negative responses in CPI
inflation. Interest rates respond contractionarily to GPR at high rates but accommodate at low
rates—consistent with Lhuissier & Tripier (2021) and the “toxic interaction" between uncertainty
and tight financial conditions (Caldara, Fuentes-Albero, Gilchrist & Zakrajšek, 2016). The impulse
responses for France (Figures A.1.12 and A.1.13) indicate that in the high-rate states, EPU leads
to higher unemployment (peaking around months 18–20), higher REER (appreciation), and lower
oil prices (peaking around month 12). In addition, CPI inflation disinflates initially but turns
modestly positive after month 16. GPR shocks result in higher policy rates and lower CPI inflation,
with the peak (negative) inflation effects materializing in months 2-4. In contrast, in the low-rate


16


regime, unemployment’s response to EPU shocks is more gradual, yet it remains elevated through
month 20. Policy rates fall more noticeably during months 12-15. Furthermore, CPI inflation
responses are consistently negative throughout the forecast horizon. These results, which echo
those for the euro area as a whole, are consistent with those reported by Castelnuovo (2019) for
European countries, where they observe that uncertainty appears to have different transmission
channels depending on the current policy rate environment. The impulse responses for the German
economy (Figures A.1.14 and A.1.15) are also consistent with safe-haven effects. An increase in
GPR raises unemployment, and this effect is persistent (remaining positive until month 20). The
REER appreciates, peaking at about month 10. The response of interest rates to GPR turns
positive after an initial period of accommodation and persists for the whole sample period. The
response of CPI inflation is negative at first but becomes positive after month 10. All these features
are consistent with a safe-haven role, also characterized by a credible commitment to price stability.
The impulse responses for the low-rate state are instead different: unemployment jumps up following
a shock to EPU, with the largest response at its peak, and then declining. The response of the
REER to EPU is hump-shaped, peaking at months 10–12. The response of oil prices to EPU
turns positive after an initial period of negative values. The response of CPI inflation is mostly
countercyclical in the low-rate state, but it turns procyclical in the high-rate state (Berg, 2019;
Grimme & Stöckli, 2018). The IRFs for Japan (Figures A.1.16 and A.1.17) show state-dependent
transmission and strong exchange-rate channels. High-rate episodes are characterized by EPUinduced oscillatory unemployment dynamics, a peak effect around month 18, and sizeable delayed
REER appreciation after month 12, all in line with the safe-haven properties of the yen and the
Bank of Japan’s gradualist policy stance. Low-rate episodes are instead associated with more
muted unemployment dynamics, more contained USEMV responses, and a switch from positive to
negative CPI inflation responses—aligning with Japan’s deflationary bias and the structural labormarket frictions highlighted by Miyamoto (2016). The larger responses in size and volatility under
tight policy conditions are also consistent with Lhuissier & Tripier (2021)’s result that financial
frictions amplify the effects of uncertainty when monetary policy has little room to maneuver. In
the United Kingdom (Figures A.1.18 and A.1.19), an exchange-rate–inflation nexus is quite evident.
In the high-rate regime, EPU increases unemployment (highest response around month 14) and is
associated with persistent REER depreciation; CPI inflation displays an initial inflationary pulse
followed by persistent disinflation (lasting to month 12). Interest rates act in a counter-cyclical way,
with persistent negative responses, which can be interpreted as consistent with a “stabilization first”
rather than a pure inflation-targeting policy in the face of geopolitical tensions. In the low-rate
regime, unemployment responds to EPU more persistently, USEMV elicits a hump-shaped oil price
response (with the maximum effect around month 16), and CPI inflation disinflates throughout;
GPR displays persistent negative pressure on prices. These asymmetries are also consistent with
the United Kingdom’s nonlinear projections in (Hauzenberger, Huber, Marcellino & Petz, 2025) and
with a heightened sensitivity of the United Kingdom’s financial conditions, and their impact on the
economy, in situations where policy space is more limited (Cesa-Bianchi, Thwaites & Vicondoa,
2020). For Italy (Figures A.1.20 and A.1.21), the difference between regimes is more in the nature
of real-side adjustment: under high rates, EPU causes unemployment to increase moderately and
persistently over months 12–16, the REER to appreciate, and oil prices to fall with large negative
responses. There is some negative response for CPI inflation initially before a mild recovery. Lowrate effects of the same shocks have more persistent unemployment (running through to month 16),
REER depreciation, more muted negative interest rate responses, and larger oil price declines; CPI


17


inflation is negative throughout with only a tentative recovery at the end. This is in line with recent
euro-area evidence on real effects of uncertainty and limited offset from accommodation (Bobasu,
Quaglietti & Ricci, 2024).


To summarize, the IRF grids reveal three broad patterns that are consistent across G7 economies.
First, monetary stance matters: conditional on a given uncertainty shock, responses are typically
larger and faster in the high-rate regime than in the low-rate regime, a pattern that WCA analysis
also suggests by revealing clusters of statistically significant coherence around episodes with sharp
movements in the SIR. This finding further justifies the use of the SIR as a transition variable in
the state-dependent impulse-response design. Second, the policy-distinct measures that incorporate
external risks (GPR, USEMV) have strong transmission through REER and oil price (WTI) with
secondary effects on CPI inflation and unemployment at medium horizons; the policy-focused measures (EPU, USMPU) exhibit clearer connections to SIR, CPI inflation, and unemployment rate.
Third, cross-country heterogeneity is significant - exchange rate channels are particularly important where financial-market or energy exposures are large, while real-side adjustments predominate
elsewhere. These patterns motivate the forecasting design in what follows: incorporating the same
set of uncertainty measures as exogenous drivers in the multivariate model and conditioning the
evaluations on the monetary environment to capture the state-dependent transmission documented
here.


**4. SZBVARx Model: Methodology**


SZBVARx provides a flexible structure for multivariate forecasting, extending the classical VAR
approach by integrating Bayesian inference and allowing for exogenous variables. The model jointly
estimates parameters and latent components, ensuring robust forecast performance in the presence
of complex economic dynamics and uncertainty. The methodology builds upon the seminal work of
Sims & Zha (1998) and extends the traditional Bayesian VAR framework to incorporate exogenous
uncertainty shocks, following recent advances in Carriero, Clark & Marcellino (2015) and Chan
(2020). We employ the SZBVARx framework for multivariate macroeconomic forecasting across
G7 economies.


We specify the SZBVARx model as a reduced-form vector autoregression that jointly models _m_
endogenous macroeconomic variables while incorporating _k_ exogenous uncertainty measures. The
model captures dynamic interdependencies among macroeconomic variables through autoregressive lags of order _p_, while allowing uncertainty shocks to contemporaneously affect all endogenous
variables. The general specification takes the form:



_y_ _t_ = _µ_ +



_p_
� Φ _i_ _y_ _t−i_ + Γ _x_ _t_ + _u_ _t_ _,_ _u_ _t_ _∼N_ (0 _,_ Σ) _._ (1)


_i_ =1



In this context, _y_ _t_ = [ _y_ 1 _,t_ _, . . ., y_ _m,t_ ] _[⊤]_ _∈_ R _[m][×]_ [1] denotes the _m_ -dimensional vector of endogenous
macroeconomic variables, _µ ∈_ R _[m]_ represents the _m_ -dimensional vector of intercept terms, _x_ _t_ =

[ _x_ 1 _,t_ _, . . ., x_ _k,t_ ] _[⊤]_ _∈_ R _[k][×]_ [1] is a _k_ -dimensional vector of exogenous uncertainty measures, and _u_ _t_ _∈_ R _[m]_

represents a white noise vector. The autoregressive coefficient matrices Φ _i_ _∈_ R _[m][×][m]_, _∀i_ = _{_ 1 _, . . ., p}_


18


capture cross-variable spillovers within the macroeconomic system. The matrix Γ _∈_ R _[m][×][k]_ measures
the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty shocks on each endogenous variable, such that Γ _x_ _t_ _∈_ R _[m][×]_ [1]

represents the contemporaneous effect of the _k_ exogenous uncertainty measures on the _m_ endogenous
variables. The covariance matrix Σ _∈_ R _[m][×][m]_ is positive definite and captures the contemporaneous
covariance structure of the reduced-form errors. This specification can be expressed compactly
by defining the regressor vector _Z_ _t_ = [1 _, y_ _t_ _[⊤]_ _−_ 1 _[, . . ., y]_ _t_ _[⊤]_ _−p_ _[, x]_ _t_ _[⊤]_ []] _[⊤]_ _[∈]_ [R] _[d][×]_ [1] [ and coefficient matrix] _[ B]_ [ =]

[ _µ_ _[⊤]_ _,_ Φ _[⊤]_ 1 _[, . . .,]_ [ Φ] _[⊤]_ _p_ _[,]_ [ Γ] _[⊤]_ []] _[⊤]_ _[∈]_ [R] _[d][×][m]_ [, yielding:]


_y_ _t_ = _B_ _[⊤]_ _Z_ _t_ + _u_ _t_ _._ (2)


The regressor dimension _d_ = 1 + _mp_ + _k_ reflects the intercept term, _mp_ autoregressive coefficients,
and _k_ exogenous variable coefficients. For estimation purposes, we stack observations over _t_ =
1 _, . . ., T_ to obtain the matrix form _Y_ = _ZB_ + _U_, where the sum of squared errors SSE( _B_ ) = ( _Y −_
_ZB_ ) _[⊤]_ ( _Y −ZB_ ) forms the basis for likelihood construction. The SZBVARx framework is particularly
suited for policy analysis, as it distinguishes between endogenous macroeconomic responses and
exogenous uncertainty-driven fluctuations, enabling policymakers to assess the relative importance
of domestic versus external uncertainty sources in driving macroeconomic volatility.


_4.1. Prior Specifications_


Bayesian inference in high-dimensional macroeconomic forecasting critically depends on the
specification of prior distributions for model parameters. Following Sims & Zha (1998), we place a
matrix-normal distribution on the coefficient matrix _B_ conditional on the covariance matrix Σ, and
an inverse-Wishart prior on Σ. Let _β_ = vec( _B_ ) _∈_ R _[md][×]_ [1] denote the vectorized coefficient matrix,
where _d_ = 1 + _mp_ + _k_ is the regressor dimension and _B ∈_ R _[d][×][m]_ . The prior specification takes the
form:


_B |_ Σ _∼MN_ _d,m_ � _B_ 0 _, λ_ [2] 0 [Ω] [0] _[,]_ [ Σ] � (3)

Σ _∼IW_ (Ψ 0 _, ν_ 0 ) (4)


which is equivalent to the multivariate-normal vectorized form:


_β |_ Σ _∼N_ � _β_ 0 _,_ Σ _⊗_ _λ_ [2] 0 [Ω] [0] � (5)


where _β_ 0 = vec( _B_ 0 ) _∈_ R _[md][×]_ [1] represents the prior mean for the vectorized coefficients, Ω 0 _∈_ R _[d][×][d]_

is a positive definite matrix encoding the prior covariance over regressors, Ψ 0 _∈_ R _[m][×][m]_ is the prior
scale matrix for the covariance structure, _ν_ 0 _> m_ +1 denotes the prior degrees of freedom (ensuring
finite prior mean E[Σ] = Ψ 0 _/_ ( _ν_ 0 _−_ _m_ _−_ 1)), and _λ_ 0 _>_ 0 is the overall tightness parameter controlling
the strength of shrinkage toward the prior mean.


The SZBVARx framework adopts this conjugate _Matrix-Normal–Inverse-Wishart prior_ as it
provides computational efficiency through closed-form posterior distributions while allowing flexible control over parameter shrinkage. This prior specification is particularly well-suited for highdimensional macroeconomic forecasting, as it naturally accommodates the structure of the reducedform VAR system defined in equation (2). The Kronecker product structure Σ _⊗λ_ [2] 0 [Ω] [0] [ in equation (][5][)]
propagates cross-equation dependence via Σ, while structure in Ω 0 delivers lag-/regressor-specific


19


tuning; equation-specific tuning can be obtained by column-side scaling (e.g., equation-specific _λ_ _j_
or diagonal rescaling of Σ), all while preserving conjugacy (Bańbura et al., 2010). Smaller values
of _λ_ 0 impose tighter shrinkage toward _β_ 0, effectively regularizing the model in high-dimensional
settings. This conjugate prior structure directly shapes the model’s ability to balance signal extraction and shrinkage, which is critical for reliable multivariate forecasting in the presence of complex
economic interdependencies and uncertainty shocks. Informative, structured priors such as the
Matrix-Normal–Inverse-Wishart allow for nuanced modeling of heterogeneity and regularization,
enhancing stability and forecast reliability in complex, multi-country analyses. Given its relative
strength in balancing computational tractability, forecast accuracy, and robustness to model misspecification, we incorporate this prior specification in the flexible SZBVARx framework for G7
macroeconomic forecasting [1]


_4.2. Hyperparameter Specification_


The SZBVARx framework employs a systematic hyperparameter specification following Sims
& Zha (1998) to operationalize the prior distributions described above, with parameters selected
through grid search optimization detailed in Section 5.3. To accommodate the heterogeneous dynamics observed across G7 economies and forecast horizons, all hyperparameters are specified with
country and horizon-specific scaling, denoted by superscripts ( _c, h_ ) where _c_ indexes countries and
_h_ denotes forecast horizons. The hyperparameter tuple ( _p, λ_ 0 _, λ_ 1 _, λ_ 3 _, λ_ 4 _, λ_ 5 _, µ_ 5 _, µ_ 6 ) controls key
aspects of model specification and prior shrinkage [2] : the lag length _p_ [(] _[c,h]_ [)] _∈{_ 1 _,_ 2 _, . . ., p_ max _}_ determines the autoregressive order, while _λ_ [(] 0 _[c,h]_ [)] _≥_ 0 governs overall prior tightness as introduced in the
Matrix-Normal–Inverse-Wishart specification above. The relative shrinkage parameters _λ_ [(] 1 _[c,h]_ [)] _≥_ 0
(own versus cross-variable lag tightness), _λ_ [(] 3 _[c,h]_ [)] _≥_ 0 (lag decay with harmonic decay when _λ_ 3 = 1),
_λ_ [(] 4 _[c,h]_ [)] _≥_ 0 (intercept shrinkage), and _λ_ [(] 5 _[c,h]_ [)] _≥_ 0 (exogenous coefficient shrinkage) provide granular
control over different coefficient groups, reflecting the economic intuition that own lags typically
matter more than cross-variable effects and that coefficient importance generally declines with lag
length. The dummy observation weights _µ_ [(] 5 _[c,h]_ [)] _≥_ 0 and _µ_ [(] 6 _[c,h]_ [)] _≥_ 0 implement additional shrinkage
through sum-of-coefficients and initial-conditions constraints, with the former imposing the economically motivated restriction [�] _[p]_ _i_ =1 [Φ] _[i]_ _[ ≈]_ _[I]_ _[m]_ [ that shrinks the system toward unit root behavior]
rather than enforcing row-sum constraints (Sims & Zha, 1998; Waggoner & Zha, 2003). The MatrixNormal–Inverse-Wishart prior was employed uniformly across all G7 countries and forecast horizons
(semi-long-term and long-term), as it emerged as the superior choice in preliminary grid-search experiments. This prior’s dominance reflects its ability to balance computational tractability through
conjugacy, flexible shrinkage control via the Kronecker structure Σ _⊗_ _λ_ [2] 0 [Ω] [0] [, and proper uncertainty]


1 The SZBVARx framework supports three prior specifications: (i) the Matrix-Normal–Inverse-Wishart (MNIW) prior described above, (ii) a semi-conjugate flat-Gaussian prior, and (iii) a non-informative flat-flat prior. In
our empirical implementation for G7 macroeconomic forecasting, the MN-IW prior was unanimously selected via
grid-search optimization across all countries and forecast horizons, demonstrating its superior performance for this
application. Consequently, the prior type is not treated as a tunable hyperparameter in Section 4.2, and all results
reported herein employ the MN-IW specification.
2 Note that _λ_ 2, which appears in some Minnesota prior specifications to control cross-equation shrinkage, is omitted
in the Sims-Zha Normal-Wishart framework as cross-equation dependencies are captured through the Kronecker
structure Σ _⊗_ _λ_ [2] 0 [Ω] 0 [of the prior covariance matrix.]


20


quantification through the inverse-Wishart specification on Σ—features particularly valuable for
capturing the complex interdependencies and heterogeneous dynamics characteristic of G7 macroeconomic systems.


_4.3. Posterior Distributions and MCMC Inference_


In Bayesian macroeconomic forecasting, the posterior distribution reflects updated prior beliefs about model parameters after incorporating observed data, providing a natural framework for
uncertainty quantification that is particularly valuable in policy applications where parameter uncertainty can significantly affect forecast intervals and decision-making. Unlike classical approaches
that treat parameters as fixed unknowns, the Bayesian framework acknowledges that macroeconomic relationships evolve over time and that our knowledge of these relationships is inherently
clouded by uncertainty, making posterior distributions essential for robust inference in multivariate
forecasting, where the curse of dimensionality amplifies parameter uncertainty. Given data ( _Y, Z_ )
where _Z ∈_ R _[T]_ _[×][d]_ is the regressor matrix and a chosen prior, Bayesian inference for the SZBVARx
model proceeds by updating prior beliefs about model parameters using the reduced-form Gaussian
likelihood:

_L_ ( _B,_ Σ _| Y, Z_ ) _∝|_ Σ _|_ _[−][T/]_ [2] exp � _−_ [1] 2 [tr] �Σ _[−]_ [1] ( _Y −_ _ZB_ ) _[⊤]_ ( _Y −_ _ZB_ )� [�] _,_ (6)


where _B ∈_ R _[d][×][m]_ and Σ _∈_ R _[m][×][m]_ . Under the conjugate Matrix-Normal–Inverse-Wishart prior
specified in Equations (3)–(4), the posterior distributions retain the same functional form. Because
of full conjugacy, the joint posterior factorizes as


_p_ (Σ _, B | Y, Z_ ) = _p_ (Σ _| Y, Z_ ) _p_ ( _B |_ Σ _, Y, Z_ ) _,_ (7)


yielding closed-form conditional posteriors:


_B |_ Σ _, Y, Z ∼MN_ _d,m_ ( _B,_ [¯] Ω [¯] _,_ Σ) _,_ (8)

Σ _| Y, Z ∼IW_ (Ψ [¯] _,_ ¯ _ν_ ) _,_ (9)


with posterior hyperparameters:
¯Ω _[−]_ [1] = ( _λ_ [2] 0 [Ω] [0] [)] _[−]_ [1] [ +] _[ Z]_ _[⊤]_ _[Z,]_ (10)


representing the posterior precision matrix for the coefficient covariance that combines prior information with the observed regressor cross-product;


_B_ ¯ = ¯Ω ( _λ_ [2] 0 [Ω] [0] [)] _[−]_ [1] _[B]_ [0] [+] _[ Z]_ _[⊤]_ _[Y]_ _,_ (11)
� �


the posterior mean coefficient matrix that optimally weights the prior mean _B_ 0 and the data-driven
OLS estimate;


¯Ψ = Ψ 0 + ( _Y −_ _Z_ ¯ _B_ ) _[⊤]_ ( _Y −_ _Z_ ¯ _B_ ) + ( ¯ _B −_ _B_ 0 ) _[⊤]_ ( _λ_ [2] 0 [Ω] [0] [)] _[−]_ [1] [( ¯] _[B][ −]_ _[B]_ [0] [)] _[,]_ (12)


the posterior scale matrix for Σ that accumulates prior scale, observed sum-of-squares, and adjustment terms reflecting the updating from prior to posterior mean; and


_ν_ ¯ = _ν_ 0 + _T,_ (13)


21


the posterior degrees of freedom that increase with sample size _T_ . Equivalently, in vectorized form:


_β |_ Σ _, Y, Z ∼N_ ( _β,_ [¯] Σ _⊗_ Ω) [¯] _,_ (14)


where _β_ = vec( _B_ ) and _β_ [¯] = vec( _B_ [¯] ).


Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference can proceed via two equivalent approaches. For
direct sampling, we draw independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) posterior samples: for
_s_ = 1 _, . . ., S_, draw Σ [(] _[s]_ [)] _∼IW_ (Ψ [¯] _,_ ¯ _ν_ ) and then _B_ [(] _[s]_ [)] _∼MN_ _d,m_ ( _B,_ [¯] Ω [¯] _,_ Σ [(] _[s]_ [)] ), yielding i.i.d. posterior
draws. Alternatively, for a Gibbs sampler with conditional dependence on the current draw, we
alternate _B_ [(] _[s]_ [)] _∼MN_ _d,m_ ( _B,_ [¯] Ω [¯] _,_ Σ [(] _[s][−]_ [1)] ) and Σ [(] _[s]_ [)] _∼IW_ (Ψ 0 + ( _Y −_ _ZB_ [(] _[s]_ [)] ) _[⊤]_ ( _Y −_ _ZB_ [(] _[s]_ [)] ) _, ν_ 0 + _T_ ).
Both approaches are correct and yield a sequence of parameter draws _{_ ( _B_ [(] _[s]_ [)] _,_ Σ [(] _[s]_ [)] ) _}_ _[S]_ _s_ =1 [whose em-]
pirical distribution approximates the joint posterior, enabling Bayesian credible prediction intervals
and posterior predictive inference essential for uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional G7
macroeconomic applications with country and horizon-specific hyperparameters configurations.


_4.4. Forecast Generation and Stability_


The SZBVARx framework generates forecasts through posterior predictive simulations that
naturally incorporate the future shock uncertainty, providing comprehensive forecast distributions
essential for policy analysis under uncertainty. This approach leverages the full posterior distribution _{B_ [(] _[s]_ [)] _,_ Σ [(] _[s]_ [)] _}_ _[S]_ _s_ =1 [obtained from the Gibbs sampling algorithm to produce forecasts that reflect]
all sources of uncertainty inherent in multivariate macroeconomic systems. For each MCMC draw
_s_ and forecast horizon _h_, the recursive forecast equation is:



_y_ _T_ [(] _[s]_ + [)] _h|T_ [=] _[ µ]_ [(] _[s]_ [)] [ +]



_p_
� Φ [(] _i_ _[s]_ [)] _[y]_ _T_ [(] _[s]_ + [)] _h−i|T_ [+ Γ] [(] _[s]_ [)] _[x]_ _[T]_ [+] _[h]_ [ +] _[ u]_ _T_ [(] _[s]_ + [)] _h_ _[,]_ (15)

_i_ =1



where _u_ [(] _[s]_ [)]
_T_ + _h_ _[∼N]_ [(0] _[,]_ [ Σ] [(] _[s]_ [)] [)][ represents future innovations and] _[ y]_ _T_ [(] _[s]_ + [)] _j|T_ [=] _[ y]_ _[T]_ [+] _[j]_ [ for] _[ j][ ≤]_ [0][. When future]
uncertainty measures _x_ _T_ + _h_ are unobserved, we condition on policy scenarios or employ auxiliary
forecasting models with uncertainty propagation. The point forecast is computed as the posterior

mean:

_y_ _T_ + _h|y_ _T_ = [1]

_S_
� _y_ _T_ [(] _[s]_ + [)] _h|y_ _T_ _[,]_ (16)

_s_ =1



while credible intervals utilize empirical quantiles of the forecast distribution _{y_ _T_ [(] _[s]_ + [)] _h|y_ _T_ _[}]_ _s_ _[S]_ =1 [. System]
stability is ensured by verifying that all eigenvalues of the companion matrix

satisfy _|ρ_ _i_ _| <_ 1 _, ∀i_ = _{_ 1 _, . . ., mp}_, with forecasts retained only for parameter draws satisfying this
stability condition to ensure well-defined long-run dynamics (Lütkepohl, 2005). This stability check
is particularly important in high-dimensional G7 applications where the interaction between domestic variables and uncertainty shocks can potentially generate explosive behavior without proper
regularization through the country and horizon-specific prior specifications.


**5. Experimental Evaluation and Analysis of Results**


This section empirically benchmarks the proposed SZBVARx against a wide variety of baseline
models, including classical econometric models, machine learning models, and deep learning models.
The experimental setup aims to evaluate the generalization capability and effectiveness of each
model in a more realistic macroeconomic environment. The target prediction task is to forecast
the conditional changes in the next _h_ months ( _h ∈{_ 12 _,_ 24 _}_ ) of the five endogenous variables
(Unemployment Rate, REER, SIR, Oil Price (WTI), and CPI Inflation) in the presence of the four
exogenous uncertainty shocks (EPU, GPR, USEMV, and USMPU). The goal is to evaluate the
forecasting capability in both the semi-long-term (12 months) and long-term (24 months) horizons to
provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model’s performance in macroeconomic prediction tasks.
The rest of this section is structured as follows. Section 5.1 introduces the baseline algorithms.
Section 5.2 provides details on the evaluation metrics. Section 5.3 presents and discusses the
experimental results. Section 5.4 explores the statistical significance of the forecasting performance
gaps between different models, while Section 5.5 quantifies the uncertainty in predictive distributions
through credible intervals (see Appendix A.1.9 for credible intervals of the 12-month ahead forecast
horizon).


_5.1. Baseline Models_


To properly evaluate SZBVARx, we select an extended set of baseline models, representing
traditional and contemporary approaches used in macroeconomic forecasting that can accommodate exogenous variables.We use _VARx_, _Threshold VAR (TVAR)_, and _Vector exponential smoothing_
_(VES)_ as our baselines from the classical econometric literature. To benchmark against modern machine learning and deep learning, we consider _Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series with_
_exogenous variables (NBEATSx), Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series Forecasting with_
_exogenous covariates (NHITSx), CatBoost with exogenous covariates (CatBoostx) and LightGBM_
_with exogenous covariates (LGBMx)_, _Xtreme Gradient Boosting with exogenous covariates (XGBx)_,
_Temporal Fusion Transformer with exogenous covariates (TFTx)_, _Time-Series Dense Encoder with_
_exogenous covariates (TiDEx)_, _Block recurrent neural networks with exogenous covariates (BRNNx)_,
_Time-Series Mixer with exogenous covariates (TSMIXERx)_, and _DishTS ensembles augmented by_
_CatBoostx and XGBx_ ( _DTS_ _ _CBx_, _DTS_ _ _XGBx_ ). All the machine learning and neural models
can take uncertainty shocks as covariates. We provide additional details and exogenous feature
processing for each model in Appendix A.1.7.


23


_5.2. Evaluation Metrics_


To rigorously assess the forecasting accuracy and robustness of the SZBVARx, we use five
standard metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error
(SMAPE), Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE), Theil’s _U_ 1 (denoted as _TU_ 1 ), and Median Absolute
Percentage Error (MDAPE). RMSE is scale-dependent; SMAPE and MDAPE are percentage-based;
MASE rescales errors by the in-sample seasonal naïve benchmark; and _TU_ 1 is a scale-normalized
index in [0 _,_ 1]. The mathematical formulations are:



_h_

Here, _y_ _t_ denotes the observed value at time _t_, ˆ _y_ _t_ the forecast, _h_ the forecast horizon, and _D, S_ the
in-sample length and seasonal period used in MASE. Because no single metric suffices in macrocasting settings with persistence, breaks, and exogenous shocks, this suite jointly assesses magnitude accuracy (RMSE), percentage accuracy (SMAPE, MDAPE), scale-free performance relative
to a seasonal naïve benchmark (MASE), and scale-normalized error independent of units ( _TU_ 1 ).
Conventionally, the model minimizing a given error metric is regarded as the top performer (Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, 2018; Sengupta et al., 2025; Hewamalage, Ackermann & Bergmeir, 2023;
Komunjer & Owyang, 2012).


_5.3. Experimental results and baseline comparison_


We evaluate SZBVARx on the joint dynamics of five stated endogenous indicators augmented
with four exogenous uncertainty shocks. Hyperparameters are tuned by an explicit grid search in
**R** using `MSBVAR` ’s `szbvar` routine and custom orchestration, selecting the tuple ( _p, λ_ 0 _, λ_ 1 _, λ_ 3 _, λ_ 4 _,_
_λ_ 5 _, µ_ 5 _, µ_ 6 ) that minimizes a rolling multivariate RMSE on the training sample under an expandingwindow evaluation for each forecast horizon _h ∈{_ 12 _,_ 24 _}_ . For a candidate hyperparameter vector
_θ_, denote _e_ _t_ + _h|t_ ( _θ_ ) = _y_ _t_ + _h_ _−_ _y_ ˆ _t_ + _h|t_ ( _θ_ ) and _T_ _h_ the set of training-origin dates used in the grid search.
We define the Multivariate Root Mean Square Error (MRMSE) as:



MRMSE _h_ ( _θ_ ) =
~~�~~



1

_m |T_ _h_ _|_



~~�~~

_t∈T_ _h_



~~�~~ � _e_ _t_ + _h|t_ ( _θ_ ) ~~�~~ � 22 _[,]_ (17)



where _m_ = 5 is the number of endogenous variables and �� _._ �� 2 [denotes the Euclidean norm. We]
select _θ_ [ˆ] _h_ = arg min _θ_ MRMSE _h_ ( _θ_ ). This procedure respects the time-series ordering and avoids peekahead bias (Hamilton, 1994; Lütkepohl, 2005). The lag length _p_ captures the persistence structure


24


of macroeconomic relationships, while shrinkage parameters ( _λ_ 0 _, λ_ 1 _, λ_ 3 _, λ_ 4 _, λ_ 5 ) control the degree of
regularization applied to blocks of coefficients in the reduced-form specification (see Equation (1)).


The dummy-observation weights ( _µ_ 5 _, µ_ 6 ) implement, the sum-of-coefficients (long-run) and
initial-conditions/drift controls in the Sims–Zha prior, respectively, which help stabilize mediumand long-horizon dynamics (Sims & Zha, 1998; Bańbura et al., 2010; Giannone, Lenza & Primiceri,
2015). This optimization framework allows the Matrix-Normal–Inverse-Wishart (MN–IW) structure to adapt to country-specific features and horizon-specific persistence. Table 4 reveals three
economically intuitive patterns: _(i) Medium-horizon parsimony (12-month ahead horizon):_ Most
G7 countries favor _p_ = 1 with moderate overall tightness _λ_ 0 = 0 _._ 2 and light intercept shrinkage
_λ_ 4 = 0 _._ 1, consistent with first-order autoregressive sufficiency at medium horizons. The United
States is a notable exception, selecting _p_ = 4 and stronger lag decay _λ_ 3 = 3; it also uses _λ_ 5 = 0 _._ 5
and nonzero dummy weights ( _µ_ 5 _, µ_ 6 ) = (0 _._ 5 _,_ 0 _._ 5) at 12-month ahead horizon. _(ii) Longer-horizon_
_persistence (24-month ahead horizon):_ Several economies transition to higher lag orders and looser
overall tightness: France adopts _p_ = 3 with _λ_ 0 = 0 _._ 8, while Germany, the United Kingdom, and
Italy use _p_ = 4 (Germany with _λ_ 0 = 0 _._ 4). Intercept control tightens to _λ_ 4 = 0 _._ 5 for France, Germany, the United Kingdom; Italy, Canada and the United States remain at _λ_ 4 = 0 _._ 1. Lag decay
increases to _λ_ 3 = 2 for Germany (others mostly remain at 1). Relative own-vs.-cross tightness _λ_ 1
becomes less stringent for the United States (0 _._ 1) and France (0 _._ 2) at 24–month horizon, compared
with 0 _._ 05 elsewhere. _(iii) Long-run dummies and exogenous channels at 24-month ahead horizon:_
The initial-conditions/drift weight _µ_ 6 becomes active at 24–month horizon for Canada (1), France
(0 _._ 5), Germany (0 _._ 5), the United Kingdom (1), and Italy (0 _._ 5), while remaining 0 for the United
States and Japan. The sum-of-coefficients weight _µ_ 5 is already active at 12-month ahead horizon
for most countries and at 24-month ahead horizon increases for the United States (to 1), decreases
for Japan (to 0 _._ 5), and remains 1 elsewhere except France ( _µ_ 5 = 0 at 24-month ahead horizon).
Shrinkage on exogenous coefficients is relaxed at 24-month ahead horizon for Canada ( _λ_ 5 = 1),
and Italy ( _λ_ 5 = 0 _._ 5), allowing stronger transmission from uncertainty shocks; other countries retain
_λ_ 5 = 0 at 24-month ahead horizon. The grid search evaluated three reduced-form prior families:
Normal–Wishart (conjugate MN–IW), Flat–Gaussian (Gaussian on vec( _B_ ) with Jeffreys prior on
Σ), and Flat–Flat. The MN–IW specification was unanimously selected across all G7 countries
and both horizons (Table 4). Conjugacy yields closed-form posteriors and exact Gibbs updates
for ( _B,_ Σ), promotes coherent cross-equation shrinkage, and tends to improve forecast robustness
in medium-dimensional systems (Sims & Zha, 1998; Bańbura et al., 2010; Giannone et al., 2015;
Carriero et al., 2015).


Against the baselines in Section 5.1 SZBVARx achieves one of the best and most consistent
performances across both horizons (Section 5.4). The SZBVARx model was implemented in **R** via
the `MSBVAR` package, while baseline models used `tsDyn` and `legion` in **R** and `Darts` in Python. The
effectiveness of the proposed SZBVARx model lies in its ability to harness the benefits of hierarchical
shrinkage to regularize the VARx system. This hierarchical shrinkage penalizes both variance
inflation when increasing the dimension of the system ( _p_ ), and allows for cross-equation coherence
and structural flexibility to capture near-unit-root processes and level shifts with hyperparameters
( _µ_ 5 _, µ_ 6 ). The competing VARx baseline has no regularization and is subject to overfitting in higher
dimensions. TVAR alternatives require very large datasets for stable estimation of regimes, but
underperform at long horizons. Alternative state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning


25


models can potentially achieve high performance on long stationary panels, but in general, are
over-parameterized in short macroeconomic samples, leading to overfitting. Overall, principled
regularization of SZBVARx results in robust, interpretable, and superior forecasting performance
under various macroeconomic environments.

The country-horizon patterns in Table 4 thus reflect an adaptive, economically disciplined prior:
tight where data is informative, permissive where persistence and breaks dominate, a configuration
that underwrites SZBVARx’s robust, low-variance forecasts for the G7. Across Tables 5–11, SZBVARx delivers the most consistent top-tier performance across the five targets, both horizons, and
scoring metrics. On the Unemployment Rate, SZBVARx is best at a 24-month-ahead horizon in
France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, and is highly competitive elsewhere, while VARx leads in
Canada and the United States, and TVAR in Germany; Japan’s best is VES. For CPI Inflation at
the 24-month-ahead horizon, SZBVARx tops the list in Canada and in the United States, whereas
VARx or TVAR dominate elsewhere (France: VARx; Germany: TVAR; United Kingdom: VARx;
Italy: TVAR; Japan: VARx). For REER at a 24-month-ahead horizon, SZBVARx ranks first in
Canada, France, and Italy, TVAR leading in the United States and Japan, XGBx in Germany, and
CatBoostx in the UK. In Oil Price (WTI) at a 24-month-ahead horizon, SZBVARx leads in four
countries - Canada, the United States, France, and Japan - with NHITSx winning in Germany
and Italy and NBEATSx in the United Kingdom. For SIR at a 24-month-ahead horizon, deep nets
generally dominate (e.g., BRNNx: Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy); Japan’s
best is DTS_CBx, while SZBVARx is often strongest at a 12-month-ahead horizon (e.g., Canada;
France; Italy). Scale-normalized diagnostics corroborate these patterns: unemployment rate at
24-month-ahead horizon posts low TU 1 for SZBVARx in France/United Kingdom and Italy; CPI


26


Inflation at 24-month-ahead horizon yields efficient TU 1 for Canada, United States; and oil price
(WTI) at 24-month-ahead horizon records uniformly small TU 1 across countries, indicating strong
_scale-adjusted_ accuracy.

Taken together, our results document the enhanced forecast performance of SZBVARx in com

plex, shock-prone macroeconomic environments. SZBVARx outperforms the classic VARx and
VES in the nonstationary regimes and, in particular, provides much lower forecast variance than
the machine learning and deep learning approaches when the sample sizes are small or moderately
large. In particular, CatBoostx and VARx appear to be sensible baselines for the semi-long-term
forecast (exchange rate and interest rate series), but quickly deteriorate in volatile and persistent
environments. The broad evidence suggests the benefits of Bayesian shrinkage, explicitly modeling uncertainty, and carefully calibrating the prior for multivariate macroeconomic forecasting.
The model’s performance evaluation endorses SZBVARx as a principled framework that provides
a robust, stable, and interpretable platform for policy analysis across different G7 regimes.


_5.4. Statistical significance of the results_


As a further robustness check on the stability of our findings, we also conduct the multiple
comparisons with the best (MCB) procedure (Lee & Lee, 2018). The MCB is a non-parametric
multiple testing procedure that simultaneously compares multiple algorithms and settings with
regard to their predictive accuracy. In the MCB test, we rank all algorithms according to the
RMSE metric across all five target macroeconomic variables, and two forecast horizons (“semi-longterm” and “long-term”) for all G7 economies. The MCB test is based on the Nemenyi post-hoc
procedure that corrects for the increase in Type I error arising from the multiple simultaneous
comparisons (Koning, Franses, Hibon & Stekler, 2005; Svetunkov, 2023). For each algorithm _i_
evaluated across _D_ datasets, the mean rank _R_ [¯] _i_ is computed as:



¯
_R_ _i_ = [1]

_D_



_D_
� _R_ _ij_ (18)

_j_ =1



where _R_ _ij_ denotes the rank of algorithm _i_ on dataset _j_ . The critical distance at significance level
_α_ follows the Tukey distribution:



_CD_ _α_ = _q_ _α_



~~�~~



_A_ ( _A_ + 1)

(19)
6 _D_



In this expression, _q_ _α_ is the critical value from the Tukey distribution at level _α_, _A_ is the number
of algorithms, and _D_ is the evaluation datasets. Two algorithms are statistically significantly
different if _|R_ _i_ _−_ _R_ _j_ _| > CD_ _α_ . As shown in Figure 4, the MCB analysis reveals a non-negligible
degree of performance heterogeneity across the forecasting algorithms for the five macroeconomic
indicators. SZBVARx consistently achieves the lowest mean ranks and its dominance in terms of
RMSE performance over the full set of key variables is statistically confirmed. SZBVARx has mean
ranks of 2.71, 3.43, 5.14, 2.00, and 5.14 for the unemployment rate, REER, SIR, oil price (WTI), and
CPI inflation, respectively. The statistical significance is derived from the critical intervals resulting
from the MCB procedure with the critical distance value of 5.34 (the upper part of the critical
distance for the SZBVARx model, represented by the grey shaded regions in Figure 4, is used as the
reference value for the test and is compared to other competing algorithms), where a number of top
methods such as NBEATSx, NHITSx, and TSMIXERx have mean ranks that are significantly higher

with non-overlapping critical intervals. In the case of deep learning and transformer-based models,
TiDEx and TFTx exhibit a moderate level of performance for most of the variables, whereas BRNNx
is conspicuously placed at the bottom for REER and oil price (WTI), with mean ranks that are above
10. At the same time, there also exists a group of competitive alternatives that occupy a second-tier
position across several variables. In particular, VARx often is on par with top-performing models,
and CatBoostx, outperforms most of the machine learning alternatives. CatBoostx demonstrates
competitive performance for specific macroeconomic variables such as SIR, where it is the secondbest (5.79) method only after SZBVARx, thus supporting its potential for practical applicability
to monetary policy-related time series. NBEATSx is also able to show promising performance for
oil price forecasting, with a mean rank that is the same as SZBVARx (2.00). The MCB test also
suggests that the results are robust across the two forecast horizons. The fact that this pattern
of algorithmic performance is observed across variables with fundamentally different statistical
characteristics and volatility patterns further reinforces the evidence in favor of SZBVARx and its
ability to provide consistently accurate forecasts for a range of multivariate macroeconomic time
series for the G7 economies. The most strategically relevant baseline algorithms for comparison
with SZBVARx across G7 countries, according to the results of the MCB test, are VARx and
CatBoostx. The former is able to demonstrate competitive performance for unemployment rate
and REER forecasting, where it consistently achieves second place in these two indicators. The
latter exhibits strong performance for SIR, where it ranks second after SZBVARx. This aspect can
be seen as a sign of its specialized applicability to time series that are directly relevant for monetary
policy. Thus, their combination as complementary baselines is an ideal way to assess the relative
performance of SZBVARx across the full set of variables and forecasting horizons.


Expanding on the MCB test described above, we apply a Murphy diagram (MD) difference
analysis to further stress-test the statistical significance of the forecasting performances across G7
nations. The MD difference approach considered in this section operationalizes the extremal score
framework of Ehm, Gneiting, Jordan & Krüger (2016) for rigorous pairwise comparison of forecasting methods on a large class of consistent scoring functions. The MD difference approach specifies
extremal scoring functions that evaluate forecast performance on account of threshold-dependent
decision problems (Ziegel, Krüger, Jordan & Fasciati, 2017). For two competing forecasts from different forecasting methods with corresponding observations, where forecasts are point predictions,
the extremal score at threshold parameter _θ_ is defined as:



_S_ _θ_ ( _x, y_ ) =














( _α −_ 1)( _y −_ _θ_ ) if _y ≤_ _θ < x_


_α_ ( _y −_ _θ_ ) if _x ≤_ _θ < y_



(20)



0 otherwise



where _x_ represents the forecast value, _y_ represents the actual observed value at time _t_, _α ∈_ (0 _,_ 1) is
the expectile level parameter controlling asymmetric penalization (with _α_ = 0 _._ 5 providing symmetric scoring), and _θ ∈_ R is the threshold parameter (Ehm et al., 2016). This formulation implements
the elementary scoring function for expectiles, representing a special case of the consistent scoring
function family for expectile functionals as established in Gneiting (2011). Following the scoring
convention, lower extremal scores indicate superior forecasting performance. The Murphy diagram
difference function computes the performance differential between two forecasting methods across


33


the spectrum of threshold values:


_D_ ( _θ_ ) = _S_ _θ_ (ˆ _y_ SZBVARx _, y_ ) _−S_ _θ_ (ˆ _y_ baseline _, y_ ) = [1]

_N_



_N_
�[ _S_ _θ_ (ˆ _y_ SZBVARx _,t_ _, y_ _t_ ) _−S_ _θ_ (ˆ _y_ baseline _,t_ _, y_ _t_ )] (21)


_t_ =1



where _S_ _θ_ (ˆ _y_ _j_ _, y_ ) represents the mean extremal score for forecasting method _j_ at threshold _θ_, and
_N_ is the total number of forecast-observation pairs. Since lower extremal scores indicate better
performance, negative values of _D_ ( _θ_ ) indicate superior performance of SZBVARx, while positive
values suggest the baseline method (VARx or CatBoost) performs better at the given threshold.
To account for potential heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation in the score differences, we employ
the Newey-West heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) variance estimator with
Bartlett kernel and lag truncation parameter _ℓ_ (Newey & West, 1987b):

Var[ _D_ ( _θ_ )] = [1]

where _w_ _j_ = 1 _−_ _ℓ_ +1 [are Bartlett kernel weights that ensure positive semi-definiteness of the co-]

where _d_ ¯( _θ_ ) = _d_ _N_ [1] _t_ ( _θ_ �) = _Nt_ =1 _S_ _[d]_ _[t]_ _θ_ [(] (ˆ _[θ]_ _y_ [)] SZBVARx [ is the sample mean of score differences (] _,t_ _, y_ _t_ ) _−S_ _θ_ (ˆ _y_ baseline _,t_ _, y_ _t_ ) denotes the score difference at time [Andrews][,][ 1991][). The lag truncation] _t_, and

parameter is chosen as _ℓ_ = _⌊_ 4( _N/_ 100) [2] _[/]_ [9] _⌋_ following the automatic bandwidth selection rule of
Newey & West (1994). Pointwise confidence bands are constructed as:



�

_D_ ( _θ_ ) _± z_ _α/_ 2 ~~�~~ Var[ _D_ ( _θ_ )] (24)



where _z_ _α/_ 2 is the critical value from the standard normal distribution for the desired confidence
level (90% in our implementation). The threshold parameter _θ_ orchestrates forecast evaluation by
selectively emphasizing distinct dimensions of prediction error asymmetry (Holzmann & Klar, 2014).
Lower _θ_ values amplify sensitivity to systematic underestimation, while elevated values intensify
penalties for consistent overforecasting. This parametric flexibility empowers Murphy difference
diagrams to deliver distribution-agnostic performance benchmarking across competing forecasting
architectures, revealing error distribution patterns and establishing dominance hierarchies under
heterogeneous scoring regimes (Jordan, Krüger & Lerch, 2019).


This threshold-adaptive methodology complements our MCB analysis by revealing performance
heterogeneity across diverse decision-theoretic contexts, providing a more nuanced understanding
of forecasting dominance patterns beyond aggregate error metrics [3] .

Figure 5: Murphy diagram difference plots comparing SZBVARx forecasting performance against VARx and CatBoostx baselines across 12-month and 24-month-ahead forecast horizons for Canada. Panels in the first and second
columns correspond to the 12-month horizon, while panels in the third and fourth columns display the results for the
24-month horizon. The analysis covers five key macroeconomic indicators: Unemployment Rate, REER, SIR, Oil
Price (WTI), and CPI Inflation. Each subplot displays extremal score differences with 90% HAC-based confidence
bands (gray shaded areas) across threshold parameter values. Negative differences indicate superior SZBVARx performance, while the magnitude reflects the strength of the performance advantage at each decision threshold.

Figure 5 presents the Murphy difference diagram for Canada. For the unemployment rate, SZBVARx outperforms the alternatives in most of the threshold ranges between 5.2 and 6.4, while in
certain decision criteria, VARx also becomes competitive. For REER, the positive difference areas
are generally assigned to CatBoostx in threshold ranges between 98 and 100, while the negative
differences dominate overall, suggesting the superiority of SZBVARx. The oil price also displays
negative differences almost everywhere, although there are certain decision criteria where the challenger models prevail. In the case of CPI inflation, the positive difference areas are mainly related
to VARx ( _θ ≈_ 3 _._ 4 _−_ 4 _._ 3) and CatBoostx ( _θ ≈_ 3 _._ 5 _−_ 4 _._ 1) at the 12-month horizon, which may be
interpreted as the superiority of the baseline models at those threshold values. At 24 months, the
differences are negative for all decision criteria, which in turn implies the dominance of SZBVARx.
In summary, there is no methodology that is clearly superior to the others for all of the considered
threshold parameters and forecast horizons. However, each method displays its excellence in certain
decision regimes. This complementarity across approaches and decision criteria for Canada paves
the way to further our analysis with the other G7 countries.


A more nuanced view of the competitive relationships emerges when looking at the remaining G7
plots available in Appendix A.1.8 (Figures A.1.22 through A.1.27). These plots verify the general
supremacy of SZBVARx but also feature zones where either the standard VARx or CatBoostx forecasts dominate across different threshold intervals. This result indicates that forecasting dominance
is not unidirectional and that different methodologies present their own advantages depending on
the economic variable and the decision-theoretic framework in focus. When considering the competitive landscape across countries, there are significant variations. In the United States, SZBVARx
shows dominance in the unemployment indicator ( _θ ≈_ 3 _._ 5 _−_ 7) and in oil price, while baseline models are more competitive in CPI inflation decision regimes ( _θ ≈_ 3 _._ 5 _−_ 5 _._ 0 in the case of 12-month
horizon, _θ ≈_ 5 _._ 5 _−_ 8 _._ 0 in the case of 24-month horizon). The case of France presents a more marked
supremacy of SZBVARx, mainly in unemployment ( _θ ≈_ 6 _._ 8 _−_ 9 _._ 0) and SIR ( _θ ≈_ 2 _._ 8 _−_ 4 _._ 0). The
traditional models remain competitive in some specific regimes for REER ( _θ ≈_ 96 _._ 0 _−_ 97 _._ 0). The
German case can be considered the one that most strongly confirms the superiority of SZBVARx,
with negative differences across the whole spectrum of selected variables and decision thresholds of
interest: unemployment rate ( _θ ≈_ 2 _._ 8 _−_ 3 _._ 2), REER ( _θ ≈_ 98 _._ 0 _−_ 99 _._ 0), SIR ( _θ ≈_ 3 _._ 3 _−_ 4 _._ 0), and
CPI inflation ( _θ ≈_ 6 _._ 0 _−_ 8 _._ 0). In contrast, Japan shows the most even competitive situation, with
the baseline approaches showing superiority in unemployment rate ( _θ ≈_ 2 _._ 7 _−_ 2 _._ 9) and in a few
CPI inflation regimes ( _θ ≈_ 3 _._ 4 _−_ 4 _._ 0). SZBVARx models dominate the forecasting task in REER
( _θ ≈_ 75 _−_ 85, _θ ≈_ 90 _−_ 105). The case of the United Kingdom illustrates well the complementarity
of the methodological approaches. On the one hand, SZBVARx presents a clear superiority in the
REER forecasting task ( _θ ≈_ 95 _−_ 105). On the other hand, the traditional approaches are more
competitive in oil price (WTI) and in CPI inflation ( _θ ≈_ 70 _−_ 85, _θ ≈_ 4 _._ 5 _−_ 10). The Italian situation
is similar to the one just described, with baseline superiority in SIR ( _θ ≈_ 0 _−_ 1) and CPI inflation
( _θ ≈_ 2 _−_ 8), and SZBVARx advantage in unemployment rate and REER.


Augmenting the detailed findings of the Murphy difference analysis, we complement our evaluation of forecast performance differences with statistical inference on the (multivariate) DieboldMariano (DM) test statistic of Mariano & Preve (2012) [4] . The DM test is a Wald-type test that


4 The multivariate Diebold-Mariano test is implemented using the `multDM` **R** package by Drachal (2025). The R
document can be found here: `[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multDM/multDM.pdf.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multDM/multDM.pdf.)`

generalizes the original one model-versus-one to testing for equal predictive accuracy of two or more
non-nested models over a set of target series. The multivariate framework allows accounting for
serial correlation and heteroskedasticity of loss differentials while jointly testing the null hypothesis
that the competing models are all equally accurate against the alternative hypothesis that they
are not. The resulting finite-sample corrected test statistic _S_ _c_ has an asymptotic chi-squared ( _χ_ [2] )
distribution, and the finite-sample correction is shown to improve size control in moderate samples.
The test is invariant to the ordering of the models, and the testing procedure can be flexibly applied
using various loss functions. We follow Mariano & Preve (2012) and use absolute scaled error loss,
block length _q_ = 1 (standard choice), and finite-sample correction in our implementation. Table 12
reports the p-values from pairwise comparison of SZBVARx versus VARx and CatBoostx across
the G7 economies and 12-month and 24-month forecast horizons. Results that are statistically
significant at 10% (reported in bold) indicate that, overall, SZBVARx exhibits superior predictive
accuracy, especially at longer horizons and relative to CatBoostx. Notably, for Canada, the United
States, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom at 24-month horizon, the SZBVARx
outperforms both baselines and exhibits several cases of significance at 12-month horizon. VARx
and CatBoostx occasionally show parity or local advantage, but the multivariate DM test results
largely confirm the relative superiority and robustness of the SZBVARx approach for multivariate
macroeconomic forecasting in the presence of exogenous uncertainty shocks.


To augment the multivariate Diebold-Mariano test results further, we also employ the unconditional multivariate Giacomini-White (GW) test (Borup, Eriksen, Kjær & Thyrsgaard, 2024). The
GW test framework has three main advantages: (i) HAC covariance estimation with Parzen kernel
to account for heteroskedasticity and serial correlation in forecast errors [5], (ii) an explicit accounting for estimation uncertainty in nested model comparisons relevant for rolling window evaluation
exercises, and (iii) Wald-type of the loss differential vector, allowing for joint hypothesis testing
and more powerful statistical inference (Giacomini & White, 2006; Mariano & Preve, 2012; Hansen,
Lunde & Nason, 2011). The GW test evaluates _H_ 0 : E[∆ _L_ _t_ +1 ] = 0 (“unconditional case" since no
conditioning variables used) using a statistic _S_ = _T_ _d_ [¯] _[′]_ [ ˆ] Σ _[−]_ [1] [ ¯] _d_, where _d_ [¯] is the mean loss differential
vector, _T_ is the number of forecast observations and Σ [ˆ] is the HAC covariance matrix. Rejection of
the null hypothesis suggests that at least one of the models is superior in predictive performance.


Table A.1.1 in Appendix A.1.8 reports p-values from the unconditional multivariate GW test
for SZBVARx versus VARx and CatBoostx, spanning G7 economies, five macroeconomic indicators, and both 12- and 24-month forecast horizons. The results provide compelling evidence of
SZBVARx’s forecasting edge, with 101 out of 140 tests (72.14%) significant at the 10% level. Significance rates are uniformly high across countries—ranging from 65% (Canada), 70% (France, United
States) to 75% (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Japan)—and across variables, peaking at 78.57%
for both unemployment rate and SIR, and remaining robust for REER (75.00%), oil price (WTI)
(71.43%), and CPI inflation (57.14%). Horizon-specific results further underscore SZBVARx’s dominance at longer horizons: the model outperforms CatBoostx in 80.00% and VARx in 77.14% of
24-month tests, compared to 65.71% (for both VARx and CatBoostx) at 12-month horizon, respectively. Notably, robust significance is observed for CPI inflation and SIR forecasts in Canada,
the United States, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom at 24-month horizon, with several significant results at 12-month horizon as well. Although our implementation is unconditional, the

remarkable consistency and breadth of significant results across countries, variables, and horizons
provides robust statistical evidence for the forecasting supremacy of SZBVARx over both statistical and machine learning benchmarks, especially at extended horizons and under macroeconomic
uncertainty.

_5.5. Uncertainty Quantification through Predictive Credible Intervals_


In addition to point forecasts, characterizing the predictive uncertainty is also of great interest
for economic decision-making and risk management. Bayesian forecasting yields the _predictive_
distribution for future observations _conditional on posterior-mean parameters_ . We report credible
prediction intervals that reflect _future shock uncertainty_ conditional on posterior-mean parameters
(¯ _µ,_ Φ [¯] 1 _, . . .,_ Φ [¯] _p_ _,_ Γ [¯] _,_ Σ) [¯] after hyperparameter tuning (Koop & Korobilis, 2010; Geweke & Whiteman,
2006) from Section 4.4 [6] . A _γ_ -level credible interval [ _L_ _T_ + _h_ _, U_ _T_ + _h_ ] satisfies P( _L_ _T_ + _h_ _≤_ _y_ _T_ + _h_ _≤_ _U_ _T_ + _h_ _|_
_y_ 1: _T_ ) = _γ_ . We simulate future shocks for each draw _s_ and horizon _h_ = 1 _, . . ., H_ as: [7]

Figure 6 reports the out-of-sample forecast performance of 24-month-ahead forecast of all G7
countries. We observe that the heterogeneity across the countries and across the variables in terms
of the predictive uncertainty is remarkable. The SZBVARx model outperforms the VARx and
CatBoostx baselines in comparison to the ground truth. We find that the credible intervals include
the realized values in a majority of cases across countries and variables, providing empirical evidence
that the uncertainty quantification procedure described in Equations (25)–(28) yields well-calibrated
predictive distributions for the 24-month forecast horizon. It is worth noting that in all countries
and for all variables, the credible intervals are small in the first forecast horizons and they widen at
longer horizons. This occurs because forecast uncertainty accumulates over longer horizons as shock
uncertainty compounds over time in Bayesian predictive intervals. We see relatively narrow intervals
for unemployment rate forecasts in the United Kingdom and Italy, moderate uncertainty bands in
Japan and Germany, and substantially wider uncertainty in Canada, France, and the United States.
For REER predictions, we observe the tightest intervals in Germany and the United States, followed
by the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, while Canada and Japan feature broader uncertainty.
Tight intervals are also observed in the United States and Germany for SIR forecasts, while the
uncertainty is moderate in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan, and fairly wide in France and
Canada, in line with elevated monetary policy uncertainty in those countries. In contrast, the
intervals for oil price predictions are consistently wide but relatively homogeneous across all G7
countries, highlighting the high volatility and geopolitical risk sensitivity in energy markets. CPI

macroeconomic indicators using SZBVARx model. Each subplot displays interval width distributions across G7
economies for: Unemployment Rate, REER, SIR, Oil Price (WTI), and CPI Inflation. Lower interval widths indicate
superior prediction precision and enhanced forecast reliability.


inflation forecasts stand out with the most cross-country heterogeneity: the United Kingdom, the
United States, and Germany maintain relatively narrow intervals, while Italy and Canada exhibit
moderate to wide uncertainty, and France and Japan display exceptionally wide intervals, reflecting
high inflation volatility and policy uncertainty in the forecast period. The 12-month ahead forecast
results, presented in Appendix A.1.9 and Figure A.1.28, exhibit qualitatively similar patterns with
narrower credible intervals overall, reflecting reduced forecast uncertainty at shorter horizons.


To better understand the cross-country heterogeneity in the forecast uncertainty, Figure 7 plots
the average width of the 50% predictive credible intervals across the five macroeconomic variables
in each of the G7 countries [12] . The radar chart shows that the unemployment rate intervals have
the smallest range in the United Kingdom (2.3) and the widest range in France (36.0); the REER
intervals are the narrowest in Germany (4.7) and the widest in Japan (18.4); the SIR intervals
range from the smallest in the United States (4.2) to the largest in France (21.8) reflecting the
cross-country heterogeneity in the monetary policy uncertainty; the oil price intervals are the most
homogeneous across the G7 countries (19–21) with the narrowest range in Germany; and the CPI
inflation intervals are the most dispersed ranging from the United Kingdom (5.9) to Japan (55.5),
with France (33.0) and Japan exhibiting abnormally high inflation uncertainty during the forecast
horizon. These point-wise summary measures are in line with the visual patterns in Figure 6
and highlight the importance of quantifying the forecast uncertainty on both the country and the
variable dimensions.


**6. Policy Implications**


The empirical results of this paper point to several policy-relevant facts. First, uncertainty
shocks are economically meaningful and transmit through identifiable channels. Geopolitical risk


12 We report the average width of 50% predictive credible intervals to provide a standardized measure of forecast
uncertainty that is directly comparable across countries and variables. Mathematically, the interval width _W_ 0 _._ 50 =
_Q_ 0 _._ 75 _−_ _Q_ 0 _._ 25 captures the interquartile range of the predictive distribution, where _Q_ _p_ denotes the _p_ -th quantile. This
choice is consistent with _γ_ = 0 _._ 50 used in constructing the predictive credible intervals and provides a robust measure
of central dispersion that is less sensitive to extreme tail behavior than wider intervals, making it particularly suitable
for cross-country comparisons.

and equity-market volatility primarily operate via the external sector—appreciations (depreciations)
of the REER and movements in oil prices; while economic policy uncertainty and monetary policy
uncertainty affect the SIR, inflation, and unemployment. Second, transmission is state dependent:
impulse responses are typically larger and faster in high-rate (tight) regimes and more persistent
but diminished in low-rate (easy) regimes, indicating an interaction between uncertainty, financial
frictions, and available policy space (Caldara et al., 2016; Lhuissier & Tripier, 2021). Third, the
proposed SZBVARx delivers superior accuracy at 12–24 months, consistent with the advantages
of Bayesian shrinkage and stochastic-volatility priors in high-dimensional settings (Bańbura et al.,
2010; Carriero et al., 2019a). Finally, the Bayesian predictive credible intervals demonstrate reasonable empirical coverage and appropriately scale with forecast horizon, providing credible uncertainty
quantification that is essential for policy communication, risk assessment, and scenario planning
under macroeconomic uncertainty (Giannone et al., 2015; Clark, 2011; Knüppel, 2015).


These results have several policy implications. For monetary policy, the decision framework
should condition explicitly on the rate regime and contemporaneous uncertainty indicators. As
wavelet coherence indicates that the four uncertainty series are generally leading the macro variables, and the macro block is endogenous, it is reasonable to consider economic policy uncertainty,
geopolitical risk, equity-market volatility, and monetary policy uncertainty as exogenous shocks
for the purpose of scenario design. In practice, this means that central banks should generate
regime-conditioned (high-rate vs. low-rate) parallel projections and evaluate the degree to which
unemployment and inflation paths start to materially diverge; where divergence is sizeable, they
should lean against amplification in tight conditions and tolerate slower real-side adjustment, recognizing asymmetric interactions between uncertainty and financial conditions (Caldara et al., 2016;
Lhuissier & Tripier, 2021). Given its medium-horizon advantage, the SZBVARx is also well suited to
forward guidance, where coherence across variables over 1–2 years matters for credibility (Bernanke,
2020; Yellen, 2017).


For exchange rate and external sector management, the high prominence of the external channel
suggests that geopolitical risk and financial-market volatility may push risk premia and capital
flows in ways that induce safe-haven appreciations for some currencies and depreciation for others,
with first-round effects on competitiveness and imported inflation. In particular, small, open,
and energy-intensive economies should accompany monetary policy moves with Forex liquidity
backstops, reserve management, and transparent communication about how uncertainty shocks
translate into exchange-rate movements and the inflation target (Kilian, 2009; Caldara & Iacoviello,
2022). In the euro area, cross-country heterogeneity in exchange-rate sensitivity further argues for
the provision of national macro-stabilization tools to accompany area-wide policy in case of common
shocks with asymmetric external impacts.


For energy and commodity risk, the forecast evaluation results indicate that oil-price projections
exhibit the widest prediction intervals—particularly during global stress periods—suggesting that
fiscal and regulatory authorities should incorporate energy-price stress tests into budget planning
and sectoral oversight while supporting hedging strategies that reduce exposure to abrupt commodity swings (Kilian, 2009). Where energy import dependence is high, pre-specified contingencies
(such as temporary energy-levy adjustments or targeted transfers) can be activated when prediction
intervals for oil-price pass-through indicate elevated near-term inflation risk.


42


For fiscal policy, uncertainty shocks in low-rate regimes tend to raise unemployment while
dampening inflation, strengthening the case for automatic stabilizers that are most active when
monetary space is constrained (Auerbach & Gorodnichenko, 2012). Predictive credible intervals
provide a basis for sizing fiscal buffers ex ante: wider unemployment or inflation intervals warrant
larger precautionary space and more conservative debt-sustainability margins. The model indicates
particularly wide prediction intervals for CPI inflation or short-term interest rates; thus, budget
authorities should broaden the revenue and expenditure scenario ranges in their frameworks.


For macroprudential policy, equity-market volatility and monetary policy uncertainty propagate
via financial conditions and rate expectations. The width and skew of credible intervals around
interest rate and exchange rate forecasts can therefore guide countercyclical capital buffer calibration
and liquidity coverage targets. When the model signals widening short rate and real effective
exchange rate uncertainty under tight regimes, earlier activation and slower release of buffers can
mitigate credit-channel amplification; when regimes are stable and credible intervals are narrow,
more targeted borrower-based measures may be preferred to broad capital tightening (Carstens,
2021).


Finally, for forecast governance and communication, institutions should leverage the pointforecast gains of SZBVARx. Publishing fan charts based on predictive credible intervals can shift
attention from single central paths to risk-weighted ranges, consistent with best practice in inflationreport communication and with the need to avoid overconfidence from parametric intervals that
may be misspecified (Britton, Fisher & Whitley, 1998). A practical workflow is to (i) nowcast
and monitor the exogenous uncertainty block with thresholds that trigger scenario refreshes; (ii)
run and disclose parallel regime-conditioned projections, documenting policy choices against the
implied amplification-versus-persistence trade-off; and (iii) communicate credible intervals to anchor
expectations and guide contingency planning. While judgment is indispensable in rare regime
shifts or institutional changes, the architecture developed here offers a practical and evidence-based
template for resilient policy under uncertainty in the G7.


**7. Conclusion and Discussion**


This paper develops and evaluates an uncertainty-resilient Bayesian VAR framework with exogenous drivers (SZBVARx) for multivariate macroeconomic forecasting in the G7. The framework
integrates a compact block of external uncertainty indicators - EPU, GPR, USEMV, and USMPU with five core macroeconomic variables: unemployment rate, REER, SIR, oil price (WTI), and CPI
inflation. The central premise is that policy and geopolitical uncertainty, financial-market volatility,
and monetary policy uncertainty are systematic determinants of macroeconomic outcomes. Embedding these drivers directly in the forecasting system improves point predictions and clarifies the
mechanisms through which external risks propagate across G7 economies.


Two features set the proposed method apart on a methodological level. First, non-linear local
projections (Jordà, 2005) are used to estimate impulse responses, which are state-dependent and
path-dependent, in contrast to tightly specified structural VARs that require strong parametric
restrictions. Second, Bayesian point forecasts are combined with credible intervals derived from the


43


posterior predictive distribution to quantify forecast uncertainty across horizons (Giannone et al.,
2015; Clark, 2011). In large-scale benchmarks against 14 different methods, from classical time series
to machine learning and deep learning, at multiple horizons, the SZBVARx systematically improves
accuracy across a range of metrics. A suite of statistical tests confirms that improvements are economically meaningful and not driven by any single metric. Taken together, these results provide a
new standard for macroeconomic forecasting in advanced economies that explicitly models uncertainty and regime dependence. Although the previous section already provides a detailed discussion
of policy implications, it is worth emphasizing the immediate relevance of the framework for policymakers. The SZBVARx produces coherent medium-term projections across variables, transparent
regime-conditioned impulse responses that make the amplification–persistence trade-off explicit,
and Bayesian credible intervals suitable for fan-chart communication and contingency planning.
In an environment characterized by recurrent global shocks and evolving monetary regimes, these
features constitute a practical decision-support toolkit and a sound methodological foundation for
future, uncertainty-aware forecasting.


The findings in this paper open up several avenues for interesting extensions. Newspaperbased measures of uncertainty are noisy and cross-country comparable. Market-implied indicators,
sentiment-based gauges, or measures of supply-chain and climate-policy risk, in particular, could
be used to strengthen the robustness of our findings. Regime classification is based on the shortterm policy rate. Composite state variables that aggregate information from the policy rate and
financial-conditions indices or term-premium measures may improve classification. The parsimonious forecasting block could be expanded to more sectoral disaggregates (e.g., tradables vs. nontradables inflation; vacancy–unemployment dynamics) to better isolate policy-relevant margins.
On the uncertainty quantification side, while this paper uses Bayesian predictive credible intervals
obtained from the posterior predictive distribution, an important avenue for future research is the
use of multivariate conformal prediction intervals (Vovk, Gammerman & Shafer, 2005; Romano,
Patterson & Candes, 2019). This would be a particularly promising direction for macroeconomic
forecasting, where model uncertainty is pervasive and coverage validity is critical for policy communication. A fully real-time assessment, in which the mapping from forecasts to nowcasts would
account for publication lags and data revisions, would make the framework even more operationally
amenable. We finally point out that the approach could be easily extended to emerging markets
and developing economies, many of which are affected by different transmission channels, subject
to higher volatility, and with typically less policy space to maneuver than G7 economies. We leave
the exploration of the above directions for future work.

_A.1.4. Causal Analysis_


This appendix presents the formal mathematical details of the False Discovery Rate (FDR)
corrected Wavelet Coherence Analysis (WCA) workflow used for finding time-frequency-localized
associations and lead-lag relations between five key macroeconomic variables and four exogenous
uncertainty shocks over the G7 sample. The implementation via the `biwavelet` package in **R**
leverages the most recent advances in signal decomposition, bias correction, and valid multiple
testing control to guide valid discovery of statistically significant findings.


Let _x_ ( _t_ ) and _y_ ( _t_ ) be two discrete-time processes sampled at interval _dt_, with _t_ indexing observation times. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of _x_ ( _t_ ), using a complex Morlet mother
wavelet _ψ_ ( _·_ ) with _ω_ 0 = 6 and unit-energy normalization, is given by:



_,_
�



_′_
( _t_ _−_ _τ_ ) _dt_
_x_ ( _t_ _[′]_ ) _ψ_
� _s_
_t_ _[′]_



_s_



_W_ _x_ ( _s, τ_ ) =



~~�~~



_dt_


_s_



�



where _s_ is the scale (inverse frequency), _τ_ the translation (in time), and _ψ_ the complex conjugate
of the mother wavelet (Torrence & Compo, 1998). The cross-wavelet transform between _x_ ( _t_ ) and
_y_ ( _t_ ) is:
_W_ _xy_ ( _s, τ_ ) = _W_ _x_ ( _s, τ_ ) _· W_ _y_ ( _s, τ_ ) _,_


where _W_ _y_ ( _s, τ_ ) is the complex conjugate of the CWT of _y_ ( _t_ ).


The localized wavelet coherence, bounded by _R_ [2] ( _s, τ_ ) _∈_ [0 _,_ 1], is computed as:



_R_ [2] ( _s, τ_ ) =



�� _S_ � _s_ _[−]_ [1] _W_ _xy_ ( _s, τ_ )��� 2

_S_ ( _s_ _[−]_ [1] _|W_ _x_ ( _s, τ_ ) _|_ [2] ) _· S_ ( _s_ _[−]_ [1] _|W_ _y_ ( _s, τ_ ) _|_ [2] ) _[,]_



where _S_ ( _·_ ) represents a two-dimensional smoothing operator applied in both time and scale dimensions using a Morlet-consistent time-scale smoothing kernel (Torrence & Compo, 1998; Grinsted
et al., 2004). The phase difference, providing lead-lag information, is given by:


_ϕ_ _xy_ ( _s, τ_ ) = arg � _S_ � _s_ _[−]_ [1] _W_ _xy_ ( _s, τ_ )�� _,_


where arg( _·_ ) denotes the argument of the complex number. Lead-lag is interpreted via the phasearrow convention: right-pointing arrows indicate in-phase relationships, left-pointing arrows indicate anti-phase relationships; arrows tilting upward indicate _x_ leads _y_, and downward-tilting arrows
indicate _y_ leads _x_ ; the angle magnitude encodes the lag duration.


To address low-frequency bias in cross-power, we apply the scale normalization of Veleda, Montagne & Araujo (2012), premultiplying each transform by _[√]_ ~~_s_~~ before forming cross-power. This
correction chiefly affects cross-power estimates, while the normalized coherence _R_ [2] ( _s, τ_ ) remains
essentially invariant after smoothing operations. For auto-power bias background, see Liu, Liang
& Weisberg (2007).


Statistical significance is assessed via Monte Carlo simulation using AR(1) surrogate time series
that preserve the lag-1 autocorrelation structure of the original data, generating empirical null


58


distributions for _R_ [2] ( _s, τ_ ) at each ( _s, τ_ ) point with _B_ = 1000 realizations and significance level
_α_ = 0 _._ 05. All testing excludes regions within the cone of influence (COI) where edge effects
contaminate the wavelet transform (Torrence & Compo, 1998).


As the method involves multiple simultaneous hypothesis tests across the time-frequency grid,
control for false discoveries is ensured through a two-stage approach. First, the Benjamini-Hochberg
FDR procedure (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) is applied at each scale under positive regression
dependency on subsets conditions:


  - For a given scale _s_, let _m_ denote the number of time points under consideration outside the
COI. Compute a set of p-values _{p_ _s,τ_ 1 _, p_ _s,τ_ 2 _, ..., p_ _s,τ_ _m_ _}_ corresponding to the test for statistical
significance of coherence at each temporal location _τ_ _j_ .


  - Sort the p-values in ascending order, denoted as _p_ (1) _≤_ _p_ (2) _≤_ _. . . ≤_ _p_ ( _m_ ), where _p_ ( _k_ ) is the
_k_ _[th]_ smallest p-value among the _m_ hypotheses at scale _s_ .


  - For a chosen false discovery rate (FDR) level _α_, determine the largest integer _k_ _[∗]_ such that
_p_ ( _k_ ) _≤_ _m_ _[k]_ _[α]_ [.]


  - All points for which the p-value _p_ _s,τ_ _≤_ _p_ ( _k_ _∗_ ) are then declared statistically significant at FDR
level _α_ .


Second, to conservatively perform a global sensitivity analysis that allows for possible dependence in the time-frequency domain, we compute pooled Benjamini-Yekutieli q-values (Benjamini &
Yekutieli, 2001) over all ( _s, τ_ ) points that control FDR at any pre-specified level under any possible
dependence structure. Cluster-wise contiguity on the time-frequency plane can also be optionally
used to respect the geometry of spatial dependence. Here _k_ indexes through the hypotheses ranked
at a particular scale. _s_, _m_ is the number of time points tested at that scale outside of the COI, and
_α_ is the chosen FDR level (e.g., 0 _._ 10).


The proposed correction method rigorously limits the anticipated rate of false positives amongst
all detected time-frequency points, thereby boosting the confidence in findings from high-resolution
WCA investigations in macroeconomic frameworks. The findings denote correlation trends and leadlag interconnections, as opposed to structural causation, with phase variations delivering directional
clues concerning the temporal order between shocks in uncertainty and macroeconomic metrics.

so that higher values of _z_ _c,t−_ 1 (tight/high-rate periods) imply _F_ ( _z_ _c,t−_ 1 ) _≈_ 0 and the (1 _−F_ )-weighted
regime (regime 1, “high IR”) dominates, whereas lower values of _z_ _c,t−_ 1 (loose/low-rate periods) imply
_F_ ( _z_ _c,t−_ 1 ) _≈_ 1 and the _F_ -weighted regime (regime 2, “low IR”) dominates. We lag the transition
function to avoid contemporaneous feedback. We consider two complementary implementations
consistent with Adämmer (2019): (i) Identified-shock nonlinear LPs ( `lp_nl_iv` ). In practice, we
estimate a separate model for each uncertainty proxy _m_, treating _u_ _m,c,t_ as the identified shock
series. In this case, the regime- _r_ impulse response of variable _i_ at horizon _h_ to a unit innovation
in _u_ _m_ is the _i_ th element of **Γ** _m,r,c_ _[h]_ [, extracted using the selection vector] **[ e]** _i_ _[′]_ [, where] **[ e]** _[i]_ [ is a] _[ K][ ×]_ [ 1][ unit]
vector with unity in the _i_ th position and zeros elsewhere, enabling isolation of the specific variable’s
response from the multivariate coefficient vector:


IRF _i,m,r_ _[h]_ [=] **[ e]** _[′]_ _i_ **[Γ]** _m,r,c_ _[ h]_ _[,]_ _r ∈{_ 1 _,_ 2 _}._


(ii) VAR-based nonlinear IRFs ( `lp_nl` ). When no external shock series is supplied, `lpirfs` estimates
a reduced VAR to obtain the residual covariance **Σ**, applies a Cholesky factorization to construct
orthogonal shocks, and uses the local projection coefficients in (A.1) to compute state-dependent
IRFs by horizon, as detailed in Adämmer (2019). HAC Newey–West standard errors yield confidence
intervals:
CI 95% = [ _θ_ [ˆ] _−_ 1 _._ 96 ˆ _σ_ _NW_ ( _θ_ [ˆ] ) _,_ _θ_ [ˆ] + 1 _._ 96 ˆ _σ_ _NW_ ( _θ_ [ˆ] )] _._


Model reliability requires sufficient variation in _F_ ( _z_ _c,t−_ 1 ) so both regimes are well-represented. This
framework enables flexible, state-dependent IRF estimation while accounting for serial correlation
and smooth monetary regime shifts, following (Adämmer, 2019).

_A.1.7. Baseline Models: An overview_


Our baseline models include:


  - _Vector Autoregressive model with exogenous covariates (VARx):_ The Vector Autoregression
with exogenous variables model is a system of equations describing the joint dynamics of a set
of time series with external predictors, and thereby facilitates rich cross-variable and shock
transmission channels(Sims, 1980; Kilian, 2006; Hamilton, 2020; Tsay, 2005).


  - _Threshold Vector Autoregressive model (TVAR):_ TVAR models permit the coefficients to
switch between different regimes specified by the value of a threshold variable, and so can be
used to capture nonlinearities and regime shifts in time series data (Tsay, 1998; Lo & Zivot,
2001; Hansen, 2011). A downside to TVAR models is that they do not allow for exogenous
covariates. In practice, a _p_ -lag TVAR model with two regimes can be specified as:



**y** _t_ =



_µ_ [(1)] + [�] _[p]_ _i_ =1 **[A]** [(1)] _i_ **[y]** _[t][−][i]_ [ +] _[ ε]_ _t_ [(1)] _[,]_ if _q_ _t−d_ _≤_ _r,_
� _µ_ [(2)] + [�] _[p]_ _i_ =1 **[A]** [(2)] _i_ **[y]** _[t][−][i]_ [ +] _[ ε]_ _t_ [(2)] _[,]_ if _q_ _t−d_ _> r,_



where _q_ _t−d_ is the threshold variable (typically a lagged endogenous series), _r_ is the estimated
threshold, _d_ is the delay, and the **A** [(] _i_ _[j]_ [)] [’s are regime-specific coefficients.] The threshold is
selected by searching for the optimal value in the data. Forecasts are then generated by
fitting a TVAR over the training data, and then predicting forward to obtain the required
horizons.


- _Vector Exponential Smoothing (VES):_ VES jointly smooths and forecasts multiple time series,
capturing trend and seasonality (Svetunkov, Chen & Boylan, 2023; Hyndman, Koehler, Ord
& Snyder, 2008; De Silva, Hyndman & Snyder, 2010). VES does not natively incorporate
exogenous variables.


- _Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series with exogenous variables (NBEATSx):_ A
deep neural model using stacked fully-connected blocks and backward/forward basis expansions, for flexible and highly accurate forecasting, that allows for exogenous regressors, excels
at pure time series signal extraction (Oreshkin, Carpov, Chapados & Bengio, 2019).


- _Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series Forecasting with exogenous covariates_
_(NHITSx):_ An extended version of NBEATSx that factorizes a time series with a set of hierarchical interpolation modules. Hierarchical interpolation can better model short- and long-term
patterns simultaneously. NHITSx can also effectively support long input and output sequences
by directly learning the hierarchical basis and interpolation weights. It improves model accuracy and computational efficiency (Challu, Olivares, Oreshkin, Garza, Mergenthaler-Canseco
& Dubrawski, 2023).


- _Block Recurrent Neural Network with exogenous covariates (BRNNx):_ BlockRNN refers to
recurrent neural network models (including LSTM and GRU blocks) structured for multivariate forecasting. These models are adept at learning sequential dependencies, providing strong
performance for time series with significant temporal structure or autocorrelation, and can
also handle exogenous covariates (Herzen, Lässig, Piazzetta, Neuer, Tafti, Raille, Van Pottelbergh, Pasieka, Skrodzki, Huguenin et al., 2022).


79


  _Time-Series Mixer with exogenous covariates (TSMIXERx):_ TSMIXERx is an all-MLP (multilayer perceptron) neural architecture without recurrent or convolutional components. It models time series by mixing information both along the time axis (temporal mixing) and variable
axis (feature mixing) through specialized mixer layers, offering memory and computational
scalability. TSMIXERx is adept at capturing cross-variable dependencies and can process
exogenous variables efficiently (Chen, Li, Yoder, Arik & Pfister, 2023; Ekambaram, Jati,
Nguyen, Sinthong & Kalagnanam, 2023).


  _CatBoostx, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBMx), & Xtreme Gradient Boosting Ma-_
_chine (XGBx) with exogenous covairates:_ These are tree ensemble methods that accept both
categorical and numerical features, can model nonlinearities, and can ingest exogenous variables as additional features (Prokhorenkova, Gusev, Vorobev, Dorogush & Gulin, 2018; Ke,
Meng, Finley, Wang, Chen, Ma, Ye & Liu, 2017; Chen & Guestrin, 2016; Herzen et al., 2022).


  - _Temporal Fusion Transformer with exogenous covariates (TFTx):_ TFTx incorporates attention and gating mechanisms to balance variable selection, interpretability, and model expressiveness for multi-horizon time series forecasting with exogenous data (Lim, Arık, Loeff &
Pfister, 2021).


  - _Time-Series Dense Encoder with exogenous covariates (TiDEx):_ A recently developed deep
neural architecture with dense encoders and decoders, designed for long-term time series
prediction, offering a good trade-off between model expressivity and efficiency(Das, Kong,
Leach, Mathur, Sen & Yu, 2023).


  - _DishTS with CatBoostx (DTS_CBx) & DishTS with XGBx (DTS_XGBx) with exogenous_
_covariates:_ These two hybrid models use DishTS (Distribution Shift in Time Series Forecasting approach as proposed by Fan, Wang, Wang, Wang, Zhou & Fu (2023)) to normalize the
time series and extract robust feature representations to tackle nonstationarity and distribution shifts. The time series transformed with DishTS, along with the covariates, are fed to
CatBoostx or XGBoostx ensemble regressors. These models combine the bias-correction and
normalization from DishTS with modern gradient boosting ensembles for forecasting strength
and regularization, resulting in an improved robustness to structural shifts for macroeconomic
data (Fan et al., 2023).


It is worth emphasizing that, as in their univariate versions, TVAR and VES models in their
multivariate forms do not allow for exogenous variables to enter the model specification. This rules
out the possibility to fully account for the presence of external shocks in a multivariate setting.
Overall, this very comprehensive set of baselines allow us to robustly benchmark SZBVARx against
both conventional econometric approaches and the frontiers of machine learning.

Each panel displays the ground truth (red dotted line), point forecasts from SZBVARx (blue), VARx (green), and

forecast uncertainty. Variables shown are: Unemployment Rate, REER, SIR, Oil Price (WTI), and CPI Inflation
Rate. Rows represent countries (Canada, US, France, Germany, Japan, UK, Italy from top to bottom), while columns
represent the five macroeconomic variables.


Figure A.1.28 reports the 12-month-ahead forecast performance for all G7 countries. Overall,

results are qualitatively similar to the 24-months horizon, with some notable quantitative differences. As it is standard, the credible intervals are narrower. In particular, the SZBVARx model
exhibits, once again, a strong alignment with ground truth as compared to VARx and CatBoostx
baselines and the predictive credible intervals cover most of the realized values. In general, the
intervals are widening over time and this pattern is even more accentuated than for the 24 months
ahead horizon. The information transmission through exchange rates has the overall same features
as in the 24-month-ahead horizon. In particular, the unemployment rate displays the narrowest
intervals in the United Kingdom and Italy and the widest in France and the United States. For the
REER, the tightest intervals are estimated for Germany and the United States, while the widest
are estimated for Japan and Canada. As for the 24-mont-ahead horizon, the forecasted SIR exhibits the narrowest uncertainty bands in the United States and Germany, while the wider intervals
are obtained for France and Canada. This again points to important heterogeneity in monetary
policy across countries, which is materializing in economic activity dynamics. Predictions of oil
prices are instead fairly homogeneous across countries, with moderate uncertainty bands. Finally,
the CPI inflation forecasts show large cross-country dispersion in predictive uncertainty, with the
United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany being the countries with the narrowest intervals.
France and Japan are instead the two countries with the largest predictive uncertainty, although
the level of dispersion is smaller than for the 24-months horizon.
